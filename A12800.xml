            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it pleaſed you to</hi> appoint mee a certaine time, to giue anſwere of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, or refuſal of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: So I haue at laſt reſolued to offer it vnto you in theſe my Letters; Confeſsing ingenuouſly, (for ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects ſeeming weighty to my poore iudgement) my vnwillingneſſe thereto, if by any meanes I
<pb facs="tcp:18363:5"/> might auoide it: Howbeit, ſeeing I ſee the ſway of Authoritie ouer-ruling, and inforcing thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, partly in obedience to it, and partly for other more important reaſons ſwaying my Conſcience; I giue you to vnderſtand, that I am reſolued to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme. To the which reſolution, I confeſſe I was the rather drawen, by the mixture of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete proceedings, yet not ſo much driuen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by your publike authoritie, as drawen by your priuate lenitie and kindneſſe, and vndeſerued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect vnto my meanneſſe; I being well acquainted with the common condition of mans will which may be induced, when it cannot be inforced. And I trust with equall good conſcience and ſucceſſe, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and continue in ſeruice vnto God and to his Church in this my Conformitie, as before I did in not Conforming: And I heartily wiſh, that in the like caſe all others did the like. This I can ſay, that my indeauours haue not beene wanting to perſwade others, wherein I haue preuailed with not a few: And I am perſwaded, that if my reaſons of this point, might ſee the light (authoritie giuing way thereunto) it would more preuaile to induce men of contrarie iudgement, then many other bookes pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to that purpoſe. Not for any worth of Art
<pb facs="tcp:18363:5"/> or reading that is in them more then others, my ſelfe being the meaneſt of many thouſands for a matter of this nature: But partly in reſpect of the qualitie of the penner, (which haue beene I confeſſe a Non-conformitan) and partly becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion prooued, which inforceth the imputation of a ſinne vpon the ſufferers of ſilencing for not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; a matter which of all things the Miniſters of this kinde will least indure: And partly alſo for the ſufficiency of the Truth preſented in thoſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>Now, if any ſhall thinke the booke vnfit to bee publiſhed, becauſe it reacheth not home to prooue the conueniency or neceſsitie of the Ceremonies themſelues: they may bee pleaſed to conſider, that this poſition of mine, being onely propoſed by way of preſuppoſall, concludeth nothing to croſſe that. I haue endeauoured to prooue this, others (whoſe knowledge and dexteritie is greater) haue libertie to prooue further if they pleaſe. But this I may more then probably affirme, that the very moſt of not conforming Ministers will hearken vnto this, when (I am aſſured) they will not vnto that. My reaſons I offer to your Learned view, and correction of authoritie. If any thing bee found in them hindering the paſſage thereof, I wiſh it bee

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very part of Trueth is precious, euen the leaſt: (as the leaſt graine of muske is ſweete.) Becauſe it is the Trueth; Becauſe Gods Truth; and becauſe ſmall errors intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt ſmall Trueths, haue often euill, ſometimes pernicious effects. Which laſt appeareth in the controuerſie of our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; the ſparkles of which difference haue growen vnto great flames in this our Church. Where the fault is, as God knoweth, ſo the day will try, and God will one day iudge. But difference of appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions hath brought foorth difference of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and difference of iudgements, hath brought forth difference of practiſe, and diſagreement in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The difference of practiſe hath mooued Authority to ſilence and ſuppreſſe refuſers of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie: The diſagreement in affection, hath moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the Miniſters depriued to ſpeake euil of perſons in authority, and of Conformers: Whereby in the euent, the courſe of the Goſpell is interrupted, and
<pb facs="tcp:18363:7"/> of Popery enlarged; the friends of <hi>Sion</hi> are grieued, the enemies reioyced, the Deuill gratified, and God not pleaſed. The Church is rent with Schiſme, the Trueth ſcandalized by diſſention, &amp; the Miniſters vndone by loſſe of liuing, and the vnitie of brethren liuing in the ſame houſe, profeſsing the ſame Faith, and reioycing in the ſame Hope, is pulled in pieces: And this like to continue God knowes how long; but all men know, the longer the worſe.</p>
            <p>For which cauſe I haue vndertaken this ſeruice to Gods Church, to vnfold the ſtate of this queſtion, which as yet hath not been ſo directly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled, in my opinion, as it might, by any that I know. The Miniſters haue heretofore laboured to proue the Ceremonies euill to be vſed, and fit to be aboliſhed; but they neuer went about to prooue, whether in caſe of Depriuation they ought to haue conformed; which is the queſtion directly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their caſe. This is performed in this tractate, and reſolued by reaſon drawen from God and man, from Scripture and Authority of all ſorts, which thou (good Reader) mayeſt perceiue, if thy deſire allure thee, or thy patience will giue thee leaue to reade.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of my penning it was this: At <note place="margin">The occaſion of penning this Treatiſe.</note> firſt, being of aduerſary iudgement to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I laboured (as men doe that are ſicke of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice) to gather all I could againſt them, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from the practiſe of them, as from things ſimply euill: But after, hauing been indicted at a
<pb facs="tcp:18363:7"/> quarter Seſsions for refuſing to conforme, by ſome of my Pariſh for my fidelity in oppoſing their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered life, I was occaſioned to looke more neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ſtate of this queſtion, whether I might vſe them with my peace in any caſe, or not; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of neceſsity, &amp; Depriuation. I asked of my ſelfe two things, whether I would rather ſuffer death, then vſe them in a Church profeſsing the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and vrging them as things indifferent, not preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, as binding Conſcience in themſelues, or as needfull to ſaluation? And whether the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my Miniſtery (which was preſſed on my Conſcience with a woe, if I neglected it) ſhould not be as deare vnto me, as my life? Which queſtions, when they put mee to a ſtand, and that I could not well reſolue vnto my ſelfe, for the ill conceit I had againſt the Ceremonies, I beganne to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the iudgement of our beſt latter writers, and the practiſe of reformed Churches, from whence I went vnto antiquitie of primitiue and purer times; where with one conſent and harmonie of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I found them for the practiſe of farre more, and more offenſiue Ceremonies then ours may bee ſuppoſed, and chiefely in this caſe. This was a ground to ſtay my iudgement, and build my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: From which when once I found it, in con-conſcience I could not, in modeſtie I durſt not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part in haſte. For with what ſhew or conſcience ſhould any man turne his backe in diſlike, or his face in oppoſition to the iudgement and
<pb facs="tcp:18363:8"/> practiſe of all Churches of Chriſt ſince the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles? And from all thoſe worthy Lights, thoſe Spirituall perſons, the Teachers of the Churches, the champions of the Trueth, the Maſters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by whom, and by whom onely, God had in all ages propagated his Goſpell, conuerted ſoules, confirmed Veritie, confuted Hereſies and Errors, builded Chriſtes Church, diſcouered and ouerthrowne the Church of Antichriſt? Chiefly, ſeeing it is the iudgement not of one or two, nor of ſome againſt ſome other, but euen of All, not One excepted which is of note, or claſsicall authority: And none againſt this iudgement, excepting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted and condemned Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, ſuch as Donatiſts, Anabaptiſts, and our latter Browniſts. From thence I looked into the reaſons mouing them vnto this iudgement, &amp; that practiſe, which in this Tractate are ſet downe: So that here is no nouelty broached, or fancy of mine owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to thy view (Chriſtian reader) but Antiquity and Vniuerſality; not Papall, but Euangelicall, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture; not of Carnall, but Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perſons, which may bee to thy Conſcience as an <gap reason="foreign">

<pb facs="tcp:18363:8"/> of no light nature, to withhold the trueth in vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe: <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> next, it is a profitable trueth, which may occaſion ſome Miniſters to enter, which dare not for conformitie, and others to returne which are depriued for not conforming to the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, both tending to the benefit and edification of Gods Church. For what greater profit may there be, then that which is oppoſed to the greateſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe? For as it pleaſeth God to ſaue them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21. prou 29. 18.</note> by preaching: ſo where no viſion is, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple periſh. Secondly, it reſpecteth the miniſters of two ſorts. Firſt, ſuch as are depriued, on whom theſe reaſons doe inforce a ſinne for not confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the caſe of depriuation: and it is very ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous for Miniſters, profeſsing ſinceritie of Chriſt his Goſpel to haue begunne, and to continue in a wrong courſe; neither can they approoue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience before God or man, to beginne and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in error and not amend when they ſee a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way. Then, it concerneth the Miniſters that haue conformed in this caſe: both becauſe it ſerueth to cleere the innocencie of ſundry godly teachers, that haue conformed to preuent their depriuation, which are hardly thought of, and traduced as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliders, and betrayers of Gods cauſe. And if this trueth were knowen, they would not haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned innocents: As alſo becauſe it is meete that the hearts of ſuch as haue conformed of feare, and are wounded with griefe, ſhould bee relieued: this trueth ſeruing to quiet their afflicted conſcience,
<pb facs="tcp:18363:9"/> which muſt not bee neglected. Laſtly, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecteth my ſelfe, and that two wayes. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by ſuppreſsing of this veritie, I ſhould wrap my ſelfe in the guilte of a two fold ſin; namely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſſe to God, &amp; vnrighteouſneſſe to man. For why hath God opened my eyes to ſee this truth, but to that end I ſhould reueale it vnto others?</p>
            <p>And it were vnrighteouſneſſe, and hatred to my <note place="margin">Leu. 19. 17.</note> brethren to ſuffer them to ſin, and not to ſhew them of it, to ſee them to wander, and not to point vnto the right way. Laſtly, it were iniquitie to my ſelfe, to ſuffer my Miniſterie to be euill ſpoken of, for practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the trueth; there being ſcandall taken farre and neere at the alteration of my iudgement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of my purpoſe to conforme, rather then to ſuffer depriuation, which I may lawfully, and muſt alſo of ſome neceſsitie preuent. To this I adde the reſpect I haue vnto our Schiſmatickes, the Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, whoſe errors are hereby diſcouered, and their falſe concluſions ouerthrowne.</p>

It will be well, and more agreeing to the comfort of mens conſciences, and more fitted to the rekconing they muſt giue, to bee aduiſed before they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it. Howbeit, if I erre, it is with ſuch company, with whom in ſome caſe I had rather erre (as one ſpeaketh) then thinke or know the trueth with ſome

Acts 21. 24. 26. <hi>Paul</hi> vnto the Iew became as a Iew, to the men vnder the Law, as though he had been vnder the Law, 1. Cor. 9. 20. 4. And
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18363:14"/> cauſed others to practiſe:] For <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy:</hi> Acts 16. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> took the men, and was purified with them, Acts 21. 24. 5. Aduiſed one another:] For <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders perſwaded <hi>Paul</hi> thus to conforme: Doe this that we ſay vnto thee, take them (the votaries) purifie thy ſelfe with them, contribute with them, that they may ſhaue their heads, Acts 21. 23. 24. 6. Enioyned or commanded the practiſe of Ceremonies:] For thus did the councell of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, They laide on them thoſe neceſſary things, from which you ſhall doe well to keepe your ſelues, Acts 15. 28. 29. This conſtitution was called the Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Decrees ordained by them: Acts 16. 4. <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders ſay, Wee haue determined and written that they obſerue no ſuch things, but that they abſtaine from bloud ſtrangled, &amp;c. Acts 21. 25. 7. To whole Churches] of diuers and farre diſtant Countries and Nations, namely to the Gentiles in <hi>Antiochia, Syria, Cilicia:</hi> Acts 15. 23. 8. As matters good and neceſſary in that caſe:] For it is ſayde, it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt. Theſe neceſſary things, Acts 5. 28. From which if you keepe your ſelues you ſhall do well, verſ. 29. 9. And yet as euill and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient in ſundry maine reſpects as they can imagine ours, namely in number] for they were diuers, namely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Acts 16. 3. Shauing the head, Acts 18. 18. &amp; 21. 24. Purifying, Acts 21. 24. 26. Vowing, Acts 18. 18. &amp; 21. 23. Contributing, Acts 21. 24. Offering ſacrifices for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons purified, Acts 21. 23. Obſeruation of the Iewiſh Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, Acts 13. 14. 42. &amp; 18. 4. &amp; 17. 2. Abſtaining from bloud, Acts 15. 29. Abſtaining from ſtrangled, Acts 15. 29 10. And in nature] for they are called by the holy Ghoſt, Needleſſe ſhadowes, Col. 2. 20.

And for the further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this member, looke the proofe of the next immediate reaſon proouing this firſt point. 11. In vſe] Firſt, for that they were moſt ſtrictly preſſed on the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of weake Chriſtians by Iewiſh and contentious Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: for they were vrged <hi>ex neceſsitate ſalutis:</hi> Except ye bee circumciſed after <hi>Moſes</hi> maner yee cannot bee ſaued, Acts 15. 15. They would haue brought their conſciences in bondage by them and yoaked them, Galat. 5. 1. 3. Acts 15. 10. They would haue condemned them for the not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them, Col. 3. 16. Secondly, they were more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly accounted neceſſary euen to ſaluation, Acts 15. 1. Thirdly, they were perniciouſly abuſed for confirmation of moſt falſe, hereticall, and impious doctrines, as much as euer our Ceremonies could bee, or were by the Papiſts; as namely, that men are iuſtified by the workes of the Law, Gal. 2. 14-15-16 and 5. 4. That euery Chriſtian is bound ſtrickly on his ſaluation to keepe the whole Law, Gal. 5. 3. That there is no hope of ſaluation without the vſe of them, Acts 15. 1. That Chriſt the body was not yet come by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the ſhadow, Col. 2. 16. 17. That they are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned who vſe them not, Col. 2. 16. That the Kingdome of God ſtandeth in them, Rom. 14. 17. Yea from <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching and practiſe it might bee argued by ſome, that a man may on occaſion practiſe that, which practiſe he tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth euery where againſt, Acts 21. 21. 23. 26. Fourthly, for the latitude and compaſſe of their ſpreading, it was both amongſt them, neere and far from them euery where: Namely at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> Acts 21. 17. 20. 21. <hi>Rome,</hi> Rom. 14. 2. 5. 17. <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 15. 23. <hi>Syria,</hi> Acts 15. 23. <hi>Cilicia,</hi> Acts 15. 23 <hi>Colloſſus,</hi> Col. 2. 16. 17. 20. 21. <hi>Creete,</hi> Tit. 11. 14. <hi>Derbe, Lyſtra,</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> and thoſe quarters, Acts 16. 1. 2. 3. 12. And euill effects,] For the vſe and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of them were the occaſions of many pernicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to ſuch as abuſed them, which appeareth in this. Firſt, they bondaged their Chriſtian libertie, Gal. 4. 9. &amp; 5. 1. 3.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18363:15"/> Secondly, they made Chriſt to profit them nothing, Gal. 5. 2. Thirdly, they made them to fall away from grace, Gal. 5. 4 Fourthly, they cauſed them to turne away from the truth, Tit. 1. 14. Galat. 2. 5. Fifthly, they hindered them from obeying the truth, Galat. 5. 7. Sixtly, they were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of condemnation to them as preſſed them as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Gal. 5. 10. Seuenthly, they leauenned the whole lumpe with ſowerneſſe, Galat. 5. 9. Eightly, it occaſioned <hi>Paul</hi> to feare leaſt hee had beſtowed his labour in vaine among his hearers Gal. 4. 10. 11. Ninthly, it occaſioned <hi>Paul</hi> to wiſh them cut off which did diſquiet the Church by them, Gal. 5. 12. Tenthly, they were occaſion of <hi>Peters</hi> diſſimulation, and <hi>Pauls</hi> iuſt reprouing of him, and were meanes to bring <hi>Barnabas,</hi> a man full of the holy Ghoſt, Acts 11. 24. and other Gentiles into their diſſimulation, and to cauſe them not to goe the right way to the truth of the Goſpell, Gal. 2. 11. 12. 14. Eleuenthly, they were fit meanes to put them beſides their adoption and inheritance in heauen, Gal. 5. 10. 20. 21. 22. Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they made as much ſtirre, ſtrife, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention among Brethren in the Church, yea much more then our Ceremonies haue done, if either wee reſpect the violence and bitterneſſe thereof, or the latitude and wide ſpreading of it in ſo many and farre diſtant Countries and Churches, Galat. 5. 10. 12. troubling and diſquieting the Church. Act. 15. 24. 13. And for reaſons equiuolent part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and partly inferiour to the auoiding of depriuation:] For it appeareth that the Apoſtles vſed and inioyned the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of theſe Iewiſh inconuenient Ceremonies for theſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Firſt, for the beleeuing Iewes, to keepe them from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, being as yet zealous of the Law, and not rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the truth of the abrogation of the Legall Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies by Chriſt, that they might not be occaſioned to be drawne backe to Iudaiſme, Acts 21. 20. 21. 24. For this cauſe hee circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> becauſe of the Iewes, Acts 16. 1. 3. Secondly, for the vnbeleeuing Iewes, and that for two reaſons. One reaſon was to winne them to the Goſpell,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18363:16"/> 1. Cor. 9. 20. 21. 22. and to further their ſaluation, 1. Cor. 10. 32. 33. Another reaſon was to auoid the perſecution of the froward and malicious Iewes, as alſo to redeeme the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his Miniſtry, and of the Goſpell, which otherwiſe was like to be endangered, as fell out in the euent, Acts 21. 22. 27. 28. 30. 31. 32. Thirdly for neceſſitie, (for in that caſe they were neceſſary things, Act. 15. 28.) and expedient (for it ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, &amp; in the practiſe of them in that caſe they did wel, Act. 15. 28. 29.) namely, to appeaſe their bitter diſſentions and vehement diſputations in the Church, Acts 15. 2. 5. And to quiet the trouble and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their mindes: as if one ſhould ſay for the peace of the Church, Acts 15. 24. That thus the Churches might be eſtabliſhed in the faith, and increaſe in number dayly, Acts 16. 4 5. As doubtleſſe by Gods bleſſing ours would alſo doe, if either the Ceremonies might ſafely be remoued from the ſcandall of Papiſts, or if they were conformed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by our depriued Brethren, till libertie of Ceremonies were granted by the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>Out of this reaſon thus I argue;</p>
            <p>If the Apoſtles by direction of the holy Ghoſt, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reaſons of common and perpetuall equitie did practiſe themſelues, and cauſed others to practiſe, yea aduiſed and inioyned (as matters good and neceſſary to be done) Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as inconuenient and euill in many maine and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall reſpects, as the Ceremonies inioyned and preſcribed in our Church are ſuppoſed to be; then it followeth;</p>
            <p>That to ſuffer depriuation for refuſing to conforme to the ceremonies of our Church, is contrary to the doctrine and practiſe of the Apoſtles:</p>
            <p>But the former is true as hath beene prooued:</p>
            <p>Therefore the latter followeth alſo.</p>
            <p>So much of the firſt reaſon, prouing that the doctrine &amp; practiſe of ſuffering depriuation for refuſing to conform to our preſcribed Ceremonies, is contrary to the doctrine and practiſe of the Apoſtles, &amp; ſo ſeemeth to be an error &amp; a ſin.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:18363:16"/>
            <p> The ſecond reaſon proouing this point is this: Becauſe the ſame obiections in ſubſtance, and for the moſt part which are brought forth againſt our Ceremonies, to proue them ſimply and in nature ſin, may be obiected and applied to the practiſe and doctrine of the Apoſtles, which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by direction of the holy Ghoſt, for thoſe Iewiſh Ceremonies were <note n="*" place="margin">Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln. fol. 17.</note> 1. Humane inuentions:] for they left to be the commandements of God, and are called the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, commandements and doctrines of men, Col. 2. 22. 21. 16. 17. Titus 1. 14. <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 2. Of no neceſſary vſe] ſeeing Chriſt was come which was the body, and they the ſhadow of things to come, Coloſſ, 2. 16. 17. Heb. 10. 1. And <hi>Paul</hi> taught euery where that the Iewiſh Ceremonies muſt bee left, Acts 21. 22. <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 3. Abuſed to ſuperſtition:] for they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to the confirmation of moſt falſe and pernicious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, iuſtification by workes, Gal. 2. 3. 4. 12. 14. 15. 16. No ſaluation without them, Acts 15. 1. <hi>vt ſup.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Abrid. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. fol. 31.</note> 4. Ceremonies ſignificatiue, or of myſtical ſignification:] Yea ſacramentall Ceremonies indeed, and added to baptized perſons,] For circumciſion was a Sacrament, and all the Ceremonies of the Law were ſhadowes of things to come, Col. 2. 16. 17. Heb. 10. 1. Patternes, ſhadowes, ſimilitudes of heauenly things, Heb. 8. 5. and 9. 23. The holy Ghoſt ſignified by them, Heb. 9. 8. And the ſignification of them, were inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the Iewes that beleeued not, as alſo to the weake beleeuing Iewes, who were not inſtructed throughly. <note n="*" place="margin">Abrid. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col. fol. 37.</note> 5. Eſteemed, impoſed and obſerued as parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip:] So they were by the Iewes eſteemed, impoſed, and obſerued as neceſſary, Acts 15. 5. to ſaluation, Acts 15. 1. For which cauſe the zealous Iewes were violently offended with <hi>Paul,</hi> for teaching that Chriſtians ought not to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe their children, nor to liue after the legall cuſtomes, Acts 21. 21. 27. Yea, this argument might ſeeme to be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on the Apoſtles, who enioyned thoſe burdenſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as good and neceſſarie, Acts 15. 28. 29. and conformed vnto them for their ſake, and in the preſence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18363:17"/> of ſuch as did eſteeme and hold them as worſhips of God, Acts 15, 1. 5. &amp; 16. 3. &amp; 21. 26. <note n="*" place="margin">44. 48. fol.</note> 6. Swaruing from the generall rules and directions of the word for determining of Ceremonies,] not needfull or profitable to edification:] For how could Iewiſh ceremonies, which were antiquated, and either had no ſignification, being ſhadowes of things already come, or a falſe one, edifie the Church: nay, the euill doctrines which they eſtabliſhed, and euill effects which they produced, ſerued rather to deſtroy, then to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Church, yet their vſe and yeelding ſerued to edifie by making way to the Churches peace, and furtherance of the Goſpel. <note n="*" place="margin">44. 48. fol.</note> 7 Not profitable for order:] For it had been moſt orderly to haue ſerued God by Legall Ceremonies vnder the Law, and Euangelical vnder the Goſpel. It might ſeeme diſorder to bring backe the Legall Ceremonies which were aboliſhed, and to ioyne them with Gods worſhips in the Goſpell: yet it was order to vſe and practiſe them in that caſe, becauſe it preuented the maine diſorder and confuſion that elſe might haue inſued, namely diſcord of beleeuing Brethren, and ſuppreſſing of the Goſpel. <note n="*" place="margin">44. 48. fol.</note> 8 Not profitable for decency:] For what was more indecent, then for a Chriſtian to vſe idle, vnfruitfull, needleſſe and beggarly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments? For a Chriſtian to bee ſhaued, circumciſed, offer ſacrifice, yet did this indecency vphold a higher decency, which was the eſtabliſhment of faith, dayly increaſe of the number of Churches, Acts 16. 4. Which conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in our Ceremonies in the caſe of depriuation would alſo do. <note n="*" place="margin">45. 49. fol.</note> 9. Offenſiue many waies:] For firſt they might offend and grieue the beleeuing Gentiles, which neuer vſed them, and knew by the Apoſtles doctrine that they were to bee aboliſhed, Acts 21. 21. Galat. 2. 3, 9, 12, 15. Secondly, they did ſo ſcandalize, and were ſuch ſtumbling blockes to the beleeuing and weake Iewes, that they contended about them, as needfull to ſaluation, Acts 15. 15. And were violent againſt <hi>Paul</hi> in the defence of them, Acts 21. 21, 22, 27, 28. And ready to forſake the Chriſtian faith about
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18363:17"/> them, as perhaps ſome did. Thirdly, the hardned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuing Iewes might bee more hardened from Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and ſay, The Chriſtian religion borroweth our Ceremonies, they decline and come backe to vs. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apoſtles and the Church of God they were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, both in the violence of preſſing the neceſſitie of theſe things by the Iewes, Acts 15. 24. As alſo in impoſing that they did: For they were loath to lay any burthen, and the burthen that they layed was neceſſary for the ſtate of the Church, Acts 15. 28. Beſides they taught againſt the things they inioyned, that namely they ought not to bee vſed by Iewes and Gentiles, Acts 21. 21. Fiftly, to this we might adde, that they might tend, &amp; in the euent did ſerue indeede, as meanes to infringe the Chriſtian libertie:] For they were burdens, yokes, bondages, and oppoſite (as they were preſſed by the Iewes) to the Chriſtian libertie: Act. 15. 10, 28. Gal. 4. 9. 10. and 5. 1. yet the vſe and practiſe of theſe things, by the direction of the Apoſtles, did procure the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of the Goſpel, and the preaching thereof; like as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie to our Ceremonies would doe to preuent or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the loſſe of their Miniſtery. To this adde againe, that thoſe Ceremonies were very ſtrictly inioined] by the Iewes as neceſſary to ſaluation: Act. 15. 1, 5. <hi>As ours are now;</hi> By the Apoſtles, as neceſſary for the peace of the Church, and freedome of the Goſpel, Act. 15. 24, 28. and 21. 21, 27. In which reſpects the practiſe and conformitie to our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies may ſeeme neceſſary at this time for the appeaſing of fraternall diſcord, and furtherance of the Goſpel. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the way theſe are the chiefeſt and maine arguments, which the depriued Miniſters haue brought againſt the Ceremonies to proue them ſimply, and in their nature euil: let it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered by the iudicial &amp; godly Reader, whether they might not vpon theſe grounds except againſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles preſcription, and refuſe the practiſe of thoſe Iewiſh Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, euen with the loſſe of miniſtry &amp; interruption of the Church, as well as to ſuffer depriuatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for refuſing of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18363:18"/> Ceremonies preſcribed in the Church of England.</p>
            <p>But from this point I argue thus;</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer Ceremonies are of humane inuention, of no neceſſary vſe, abuſed to ſuperſtition, of miſticall and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſignification; eſteemed, impoſed and obſerued, as parts of Gods worſhip, ſwaruing from the generall rules of Gods word, not profitable for edification, order, or decencie, of fenſiue many wayes to the godly, weake and wicked; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing Chriſtian libertie, ſtrictly inioyned as neceſſary: ſuch Ceremonies by the doctrine of the Miniſters refuſing conformitie, are ſimply and in nature euill, and could not be practiſed by any perſons, no not the Apoſtles themſelues, and that through the direction of the holy Ghoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne.</p>
            <p>But the Iewiſh Ceremonies preſcribed and practiſed, by the Apoſtles through direction of the holy Ghoſt, were of this nature and qualitie, in euery one of the points aboue named.</p>
            <p>Therefore by the doctrine of the Miniſters refuſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie, in the caſe of depriuation, the Iewiſh Ceremonies preſcribed and practiſed, by the Apoſtles through direction of the holy Ghoſt, were ſimply and in nature euill, and could not by them be practiſed without ſinne. Or thus;</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer doctrine and practiſe, tendeth to accuſe and condemne the inſpired Apoſtles, in their inſpired practiſe and doctrine, of teaching the practiſe, and of practiſing Ceremonies, in ſundry maine reſpects, as vnlawfull as ours are pretended to bee, tendeth to accuſe and condemne the Apoſtles, in their inſpired practiſe and doctrine, for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and for practiſing things ſimply euill.</p>
            <p>But this doeth the doctrine and practiſe, of ſuffering de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation, for refuſing to conforme to our preſcribed Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies.</p>
            <p>Therefore the doctrine and practiſe of ſuffering depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for refuſing to conforme to our Ceremonies, doeth directly tend to accuſe the inſpired Apoſtles, in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18363:18"/> practiſe for teaching, and practiſing things ſimply euill. Whereupon I thus conclude;</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer doctrine or practiſe, doeth directly tend to accuſe and condemne, the inſpired Apoſtles for practiſing, teaching, and preſcribing things ſimply euill, ſuch doctrine and practiſe is erronious and ſinnefull:</p>
            <p>So doeth the practiſe and the doctrine, of ſuffering depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for refuſing to conforme vpon the grounds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged, as hath beene prooued:</p>
            <p>Therefore the doctrine and practiſe, of ſuffering depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, for refuſing to conforme vnto our Ceremonies, is erronious and ſinnefull.</p>
            <p>To this that hath beene here alleadged, there are certaine obiections made by certaine godly, graue, and learned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued Miniſters, which here I thinke fit to make anſwere vnto.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
               </label> The Apoſtles might doe many things, which wee may not doe, in reſpect of their immediate authoritie from God. Thoſe caſes were decreed by the holy Ghoſt, ours not ſo, they did it by the direction of the ſpirit: there is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene their caſe and ours: they guided by the ſpirit, we not ſo. The Apoſtles could not erre, we ſubiect to error. It is no good conſequent to ſay, they vſed ſuch and ſuch things, therefore we may: they had warrant for what they did, the holy Ghoſt gaue them warrant.</p>
            <p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwere. </seg>
               </label> Firſt it is to bee noted, that they who thus obiect againſt this reaſon, muſt needes relinquiſh the excuſes and accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtles, which others make for vſing the Iewiſh Ceremomnies vnlawfully: For the one affirming their practiſe to be vnlawfull, the other granting it to bee done by direction of the ſpirit, doe miſtically ouerthrow one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that both cannot ſtand as true. This being obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I anſwere; Firſt, if the Apoſtles were immediatly from God authorized, and did thoſe things by direction of the holy Ghoſt, as vndoubtedly they did, wee may be the bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to immitate them in their practiſe, and in their doctrine,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18363:19"/> and in ſo doing wee ſhall not erre: For in ſo doing wee may ſay, wee doe no more about matters of Ceremonies, then the Apoſtles haue done before vs. It is a point wee wiſh the Church of Rome could ſay. Secondly, though wee may not immitate the Apoſtles in things peculiar to their office, perſons and times: yet we may follow them, and are bound in conſcience ſo to doe, in matters of common equitie and generall reaſon. For as the Apoſtles had warrant from the holy Ghoſt, ſo wee haue warrant from the example of the Apoſtles, and from the reaſons, for which the holy Ghoſt mooued them to do thoſe things. For the holy Ghoſt being euer the ſame, teacheth, and ruleth the Church by one and the ſame reaſon reuealed in his word, as well now as then. Now the Apoſtles in this caſe, did vrge the practiſe of theſe Ceremonies, not from their immediate authoritie from God, nor from inſpiration onely of the holy Ghoſt: but by reaſons and rules of common and perpetuall equitie, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expediencie; It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt and vs, Acts 15. 28. and neceſſitie: theſe neceſſary things, Acts 15. 28. alſo to winne more, 1. Cor. 9. 19, 20, 21, 22. to further and propagate the Goſpel, 1. Cor. 9. 23. By the which rules the holy Ghoſt doeth teach the Church, in the like caſes of the Church, to follow the like example by the ſame generall rules: namely to practiſe the ſame Ceremonies in the like caſe, or other Ceremonies of like nature in other caſes: no leſſe then he doeth teach the Church to pray, and ſingin a language vnderſtood from the generall rule of edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. [Let all things in the Church be done to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] 1. Cor. 14. 12, 26. And for Prophets to ſpeake one after another, not many at once: and for women to hold their peace in the Church, to auoyd confuſion: from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall rule of order and honeſty. [Let all things bee done honeſtly, and by order in the Church] 1. Cor. 14. 27, 30, 31, 34, 35, 40. Which may the rather appeare, becauſe they be all caſes of one nature, namely of order, and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie in the Church and worſhip of God, which I thinke

               </label> I know and grant there is a great difference, in many circumſtances betweene the Iewiſh Ceremonies, and the Ceremonies of this our Church, but for anſwere I ſay; there is agreement betweene them, in the moſt part of thoſe many things, whereby our Ceremonies are vrged and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed to be ſimply euill and vnlawfull, as before appeareth, ſo that this obiection is nothing to the pointin queſtion, or to giue direct anſwere to this argument. For my allegation of theſe things doeth confirme thus much: Namely that it is good and neceſſary to practiſe inconuenient, ſcandalous, and hurtfull Ceremonies in a caſe of ſuperior reaſon, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of procuring the Churches peace, and libertie of the Goſpel and the like: which no man will deny, and I ſeeke no more. For admit theſe Ceremonies with vs in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie to be inconuenient, hurtfull, and ſcandalous more or leſſe, it skilleth not, ſo long as they bee of no other nature, then thoſe Iewiſh Ceremonies preſcribed, and practiſed by the Apoſtles; (as hath beene prooued they are not) how will it be auoyded, but that in caſe of ſuperior reaſon, as of auoyding depriuation of the Miniſtrie, they may lawfully, and needfully be practiſed, and that according to the minde of the holy Ghoſt, and the direction of the holy Scripture.</p>

               </label> Firſt, this obiection is nothing to the poynt in hand:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18363:20"/> For the queſtion is heere, not whether our Church doth well to preſcribe theſe Ceremonies: But whether ſuch Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies being preſcribed, as the Church conformed to by the Apoſtles decree in a caſe of neceſſitie, ought not to be conformed to by our depriued Miniſters in a caſe of like or greater neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, But the Church of England in preſcribing <note place="margin">Preface to the book of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, tit.

            <p>Firſt, Some thinking it a matter of great conſcience to depart from a piece of the leaſt of their Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Secondly ſome new fangled would innouate all things, and deſpiſe the old, nothing liking them, but that which is new: therefore they thought it expedient to take away ſome ſuch as were moſt apt to bee abuſed to ſuperſtition, and to retaine others: and in their practiſe they tooke away ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ceremonies, as time would ſerue quietly to doe it, the reſt were reſerued to keepe order, and quiet decipline in the Church. Which is further noted to King <hi>Edwards</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the Deuonſhire and Corniſhe rebells: who being <note place="margin">Anſ. to 3. Artic.

               </label> Firſt though the caſes of the Apoſtles practiſe in Act. 16. 18. 23. were voluntarily performed, that is, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of any ſuperior authority: yet the caſe of practiſe in Acts, 15. 28. 29. Was inioyned, decreed, and commanded:

            <p>Secondly, and beſides the very caſes alleadged were done by compulſion alſo of preuenting the Iewes offence: yea in a caſe of danger alſo of depriuation to the Apoſtles, if they had not conformed, as appeareth by the tumult made by the Iewes, Acts. 21. 27 28, 29, 30. Vpon a ſuppoſition of thoſe Iewes that <hi>Paul</hi> taught non-confirmitie vnto the Iewiſh ceremonies. Verſe 21. By the which tumult they raiſed, it came to paſſe, that <hi>Paul</hi> was indeed depriued from any free vſe of his Apoſtleſhip in Iudea, til he came to Rome, as appeareth in the ſequell of the hiſtory.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is true they were not alwayes by them practiſed but vpon certaine occaſions: Howbeit they were alwayes practiſed by them, when they met with the ſame occaſion of neceſſity, and would oftner haue practiſed them if by the like neceſſity they had beene driuen to it, which ſhewes the neceſſity of conforming to inconuenient ceremonies, in the caſe of depriuation.</p>
            <p>

            <p>Thirdly alſo, ſome of the preſcribed Iewiſh ceremonies endured longer in the Church, then on the ſudden may be imagined: For it is obſerued that Chriſtians abſtayned from blood and ſtrangled, till the time of Tertullian, Origen, <note place="margin">Whitaker de Ro. pon. cont. 4. queſt. 7. fol. 832. 833.</note> Syrill, Euſebius, Councell of Ganga, yea of Auguſtine, 400. yeeres after Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Concerning our ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is vntrue, that they are vrged for a perpetuity: for the preface of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer booke expreſly ſaith of the ceremonies preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed thus [they are retained for a diſcipline and order, which vpon iuſt cauſes may be altered and changed, and therefore not to be eſteemed equall to Gods Law] And for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of practiſe of our ceremonies, I ſuppoſe noe ſound Proteſtant will pleade for the neceſſity of their practiſe, or continuance, longer then the reaſon of neceſſity doeth hold.</p>

            <p n="4">4 Becauſe it cannot bee immagined, that <hi>Paul</hi> was ignorant if it were a ſinne, for hee was at the Synod at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, Chap. 15. where circumciſion &amp; other Ceremonies were denied in other caſes: and if he knew it to bee a ſinne, it were ſtrange hee ſhould ſo many times fall into a relapſe, Acts 16. 18. and 21. and obſerue the Iewiſh Sabboth ſo continually, Acts 17. 8. and 18. 4. and 13. 14. 44.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Argu. </seg>2</label> Now I proceede to the ſecond member of the firſt reaſon, which is this, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> [Becauſe the doctrine, and practiſe of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring depriuation, is againſt the grounds of Gods word] whereupon I conclude, that ſuch doctrine and practiſe, is an error and a ſinne.</p>
            <p>The grounds of Gods word, which are contraried by this doctrine and practiſe, are two in number, and they doe Miniſter two arguments, which I will proſecute in order by the helpe of God. The firſt ground is this;</p>
            <p>When two workes, or deuties commanded of God, doe meete in one practiſe, ſo as we cannot doe them both, but one of them muſt of neceſſitie be done, the other of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie muſt be left vndone, in this caſe the worke or dutie of greater reaſon, muſt be performed, and that of leſſer reaſon muſt bee neglected and omitted, and it is a ſinne to neglect the greater to performe the leſſer: Out of which ground I aſſume:</p>
            <p>But the doctrine and practiſe, of ſuffering depriuation, for refuſing to conforme, doth cauſe men to neglect greater duties, to performe the leſſer.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:18363:24"/>
            <p> Therefore the doctrine and practiſe of ſuffering depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for refuſing to conforme to our preſcribed ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is an errour and a ſinne.</p>
            <p>For the confirmation of this argument there are two poynts to be prooued.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That it is contrary to Gods word, and therefore a ſinne to paſſe by a greater worke or duety to performe a leſſer.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That to ſuffer depriuation for refuſing to conforme vnto the ceremones preſcribed in our Church, is to paſſe by a greater worke or duety to performe a leſſer; whereupon the former concluſion muſt follow of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>Touching the former poynt, namely that it is contrary to Gods word and therefore a ſinne to paſſe by a greater worke or duety to performe a leſſer: The which poynt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be in it ſelfe euident, and muſt needs bee graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by euery ſound diuine, yet for illuſtration ſake I make more manifeſt by theſe reaſons.</p>

               <label type="milestone">

Luke 11. 42. For vrging ſacrifice of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall dueties, and for omitting and reproouing mercy, Mat. 12. 7. Luke 13. 14. 15. 16. For offering ſacrifices and oblations with the neglect of parents, Matthew 15. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.</p>

            <p> Firſt, the Prieſts of the Law for breaking the Sabboths ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall, and ſtrict reſt by ſacrificing and other buſineſſe to performe Gods Publique worſhip (a greater duety) &amp; are pronounced blameleſſe therein. Mat. 12. 5.</p>
            <p>Secondly: Dauid for eating ſhew-bread (not lawfully for him to doe) in a caſe of neceſſity, hee and they who were with him, were acquitted as innocent and blameleſſe. Mat. 12. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtles of Chriſt, for plucking, rubbing, and eating the eares of corne, ſo violating the Sabbaths ſtrict and Ceremoniall reſt (a leſſer duety) to ſatiſfie hunger, the neceſſity of nature (a greater and morrall duety) were called innocent. Mat. 12. 2. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Ieſus Chriſt preferring the healing of the ſicke a greater duety, before the ſtrict keeping the Ceremoniall reſt a leſſer duty, and commanding a kind of ſeruile labour <hi>viz.</hi> the carying home of a bed in ſome caſe vnlawfull. Io. 5. 8. 9. proueth it not onely by a peculiar reaſon, proper vnto himſelfe, that hee is Lord of the Sabbath, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might ouerrule in this caſe. Mat. 12. 8. But euen by reaſons of Common equity, namely; Firſt becauſe it is lawfull, (by not ſtrictly keeping ceremoniall reſt) to doe (morrally) well on the Sabbath day, omitting ſacrifice to doe mercy. Mat. 11. 12.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the end is ſuperior to the meanes: for the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, Mar. 2. 27.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, becauſe it is contrary to the inſpired examples in the Scripture, which are of common equity and reaſon, and to the practiſe of the faithfull Saints of God, namely (beſides the forenamed examples of the Prieſts, of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, of <hi>Dauid,</hi> of our Sauiour) firſt of <hi>Salomon,</hi> who in a caſe of neceſſity, did offer vpon another Altar then the Altar appointed for the worſhip of God: becauſe it was not able to receiue the offrings. 2.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18363:25"/> ſacrifice, and to burne incenſe vpon one onely Altar in the Temple. 2. King. 23. 12. It being a Type of Chriſt, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice and mediator. Heb. 13. 10. 2. of <hi>Hezekias,</hi> who to ſet forward the mayne and ſubſtantiall worſhips of God did admit of many to the Paſſeouer, albeit they were not ceremonially ſanctified, but legally vncleane: and did not receiue the ſame as it was written in the Law, nor according to the purification of the Sanctuary; yet with a true heart ſeeking the Lord, they were accepted, namely in a caſe of ſuperiour reaſon. 2. Chron. 30. 17. 18. 19. 20. Thirdly of <hi>Paul</hi> who to ſaue his life (a greater duety) did with his owne hands caſt away into the Sea the good creatures of God, which otherwiſe ſhould haue beene preſerued, and ſo for that cauſe neglected a leſſer duety, Act. 27. 30. Fourthly, of the inſpired Apoſtles of Chriſt, who (as before is noted) did practiſe on themſelues: Act. 21. 26. and vpon others: Acts 16. 3. and did aduiſe: Act. 21. 23. 24. yea ordaine, inioyne, and command the practiſe of Iewiſh ceremonies, as circumciſion, ſhauing, purifying, abſtayning from blood, and ſtrangled meate, and that as a duty good and neceſſary, Act. 15. 28. which to auoide, and not to vſe was a duety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of God: which to vſe and practiſe in other caſes was reprooued by the holy Ghoſt: Acts 15. 10. and 21. 21.

And of ſundry perillous, and perniciouſe effects: yet this they did admit (albeit the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a duety) to doe a greater duety of ſuperior reaſon, namely, to procure the vnity of brethren: Act. 15. 2. 4. 6. 7. 24.

               <label>Ob.</label> Where it is ſayd in the former propoſition [when two dueties doe meete at one time] it is obiected that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee dueties both at once. For if they were both dueties they would both bind, and ſo a man muſt needes commit a ſinne, ſeeing hee is ſtraitned betweene two dueties, and muſt omit the one, this therefore is not well propoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <label>Anſ.</label> The mentioning of theſe two duties meeting together at one time in our practiſe doeth not intend that they doe both of them bynd the conſcience at the ſame inſtant, but they are called dueties as they are conſidered apart; being both workes are commanded of God in two ſeuerall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: Which two workes being dueties conſidered apart, doe ſometimes offer themſelues to our practiſe at one inſtant; As to heare a Sermon at the Church on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, and to tend a ſicke perſon ready to die at home at the ſametime, both are duties being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidred apart, but meeting together, and offering themſelues to our practiſe at one time, there is indeede but one duety, becauſe both cannot be performed in one inſtant; In which caſe the greater worke is the duety, the leſſer bindes not for that preſent: In like caſe for a miniſter to refuſe inconuenient ceremonies, albeit it be a duty being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered apart from the duty of preaching the word; yet when it meeteth with the duty of preaching, ſo as preaching the word will not ſtand with refuſing inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ceremonies, this refuſing of ceremonies bindeth not the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, but leaueth to be a duty. There are not two duties at that inſtant, but only one, which is to preach the word of God: In which caſe the refuſing of inconuenient Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies is no duety, neither is their practiſe a ſinne, yea the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18363:26"/> practiſe of them is a duety, if otherwiſe they cannot preach the Word; this obiection therefore needeth not.</p>

            <p>Secondly, to the inſtance of preaching in a naked man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner I ſay, that in this caſe there are two things to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: Neceſſitie, and Decency: if then he cannot preach naked but with the perill of his life, he ought to refuſe prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, it being a caſe of neceſſity, and mercy is better then ſacrifice. But if his life will conſiſt with his naked prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, hee ought to preach notwithſtanding the ſcandall or indecencie, if there bee no other meanes admitted for his preaching.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Becauſe a mans naked body, being conſidered as it is naked, it is the good creature of God, and is not indecent to be looked on but to vncleane and vaine mindes, it is decent enough to the pure.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe the gayning of ſoules and meanes of mans ſaluation, is a duety of farre greater reaſon and waight, then the auoyding of an inconuenient circumſtance of ſcandall,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18363:27"/> or of ſeeming indecencie, ariſing only by accident, not from the nature of the obiect: and the like caſe is of the practiſe of our Ceremonies to redeeme the libertie of preaching, to the place. Rom. 3. 8. which ſheweth that we may not doe the leaſt euill to compaſſe the greateſt good: I ſay, that to the preſent purpoſe wee may conſider euill two manner of wayes.</p>
            <p>For firſt, euill is either that which is formally ſimply, and in nature euill, which no circumſtance can amend: As to redeeme preaching vpon condition of blaſpheming God, Inuocating the Deuill, committing of idolatry, periury, idultery, teaching of hereſie, or the like, the which kind of euill, is intended by the Apoſtle, and may not bee done at any hand for the gayning of the greateſt good.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Againe, euill may bee taken for that which is onely circumſtantially, ceremonially or accidentally euill: which kind of euill may in ſome caſes bee practiſed without ſinne, namely, in caſe of ſuperior reaſon, at what time it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called euill. That this is ſo, appeareth in the Prieſts, who brake the Sabbath: in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who did that which was not lawfull for him to doe, and yet were blameleſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. Mat. 12. 4 5. 7. Alſo in the practiſe of Iewiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient, and many wayes euill Ceremonies, which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe was ſo farre from being euill in that caſe, that it was good and neceſſary. Act. 15. 28. 29. touching this obiection ſee more at the end of the argument.</p>

               </label> To theſe inſtances I firſt demaund whether theſe bee brought therefore to conclude, that therefore Miniſters ſhould rather die, then to vſe the Ceremonies preſcribed in our Church. And let it bee conſidered ſeriouſly by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry perſon truely fearing God: whether they thinke it fit for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:18363:28"/> another, or could reſolue himſelfe to looſe this life by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a ſtake for none other cauſe, then for refuſing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Ceremonies, eſpecially in a true Church of Chriſt, wherein there are otherwiſe a true confeſſion of faith, and ſufficient meanes of their ſaluation. If it ſhould fall out that they would not die in ſuch a caſe, I would know further, how then they could looſe their Miniſtery for not vſing them, ſeeing it were better for a Miniſter to looſe his life, then to looſe the comfort of his Miniſterie, Act. 20. 24. 1. Cor. 9. 15. If they would rather ſuffer death then vſe the Ceremonies, let them ſhew the ground and comfort they ſhould haue before the Lord in this proceeding. If they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge theſe inſtances, I wil ſhew to how ſmall purpoſe they ſerue therein: therefore I ſay, that their caſes doe farre differ from the caſe in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they were controuerſies depending betweene the heathen and profeſſed enemies of Gods Church, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the people of Gods couenant and members of the Church: our controuerſies are in the Church, and betweene profeſſed louers and beleeuers in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they were caſes of confeſſion, wherein they were called to confeſſe the trueth and religion of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gods enemies, as alſo the neceſſitie of inuocation of Gods name, and of obedience to Gods precepts: With vs the doctrine of Ceremonies is true, and according to Gods word, and the parts of our generall confeſſion in the Booke of Articles is agreeable to the word of God.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the dueties were of exceeding great moment, for the performance whereof they ſhould haue hazarded and loſt many liues. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſtood in obedience of a maine ſubſtantiall duetie (not Ceremoniall or circumſtantiall) of the firſt commandement, namely prayer to God, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of his name: for which a man ſhould rather die then intermit for the pleaſure of any mortall man: and the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of his praying toward Ieruſalem in farre diſtant place, was ſuch as ſpecially did exerciſe his faith, and to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18363:28"/> which the promiſe of audience was tyed, 2. Chron. 6. 34. The Iewes refuſing the eating of Swines fleſh, did confeſſe the whole religion of God and faith of the Church, and totall obedience to all Gods Commandements, which was that which <hi>Antiochus</hi> did aime at, as appeareth, 2. Mac. 6. 2. 7. and 18. 24. and 7. 1. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, to both caſes, the meere commandement of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and an idolater, was oppoſed to the eſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, Dan. 6. 7. 9. 10. 2. Mac. 7. 30. In which reſpect God muſt of neceſſitie bee obeyed before man, Act. 5. 29. There being no ſuch materiall circumſtance in the caſe in queſtion, whereby it alſo appeareth, that they did not neglect a greater dutie to performe a leſſer, but paſſed by an inferior dutie to performe a farre greater. And thus much of obiections to the firſt point, which being anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I proceede vnto the ſecond point which is this:</p>
            <p>That to ſuffer depriuation for refuſing to conforme, is the neglecting of a greater duetie to performe the leſſer.</p>
            <p>For the proofe and clearing this point, two trueths muſt be confirmed:</p>
            <p>The firſt that two duties, both commanded of God, doe offer themſelues in the queſtioned caſe to bee obſerued: where one of the two cannot be done, and therefore muſt be left vndone: The former dutie is to preach the word, the which duety is commanded to all the Miniſters of Chriſt, Mat. 28. 19. 20. 2. Tim. 4. 2. 1. Pet. 5. 1. 2. 1. Cor. 9. 16. and is included in the ſecond Commandement: Now this duety cannot bee done with vs ordinarily, as things doe ſtand, if Miniſters doe not conforme: for by order they are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of their Miniſtery, as very many wee ſee haue beene. <note place="margin">Lincol. Apo. arg. 1. againſt the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: Except. 2 fol. 17. &amp; arg. 4 excep. 2. fol. 45. 49.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The other duty, is to refuſe Ceremonies, as they pretend, inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient in their vſe, though in their nature indifferent, which is commanded in the ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, Ez. 14. 7, as alſo to auoid occaſions of ſuperſtition. And to preuent ſundry offences, and other inconueniences, ariſing from the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18363:29"/> vſe of things in different commanded, 1. Theſ. 5. 21. Iude verſe 23. 1. Cor. 10. 32. and 8. 9. 12. Rom. 14. 3. 4. 10. 15. 16. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23. The which deuties, in reſpect of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundry perſons, which will take offence in the vſe of them, cannot be well performed, if Miniſters doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme vnto the Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point is this, that for a Miniſter to continue in preaching, is a greater deutie of ſuperior reaſon, and of higher bond to tye the conſcience, then the dutie of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring vnto fit Ceremonies, or of refuſing inconuenient Ceremonies, ſuch as ours are preſumed to be. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by reaſons, drawne firſt from their nature, and ſecondly, from their effects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, from the nature of either worke or dutie: it is manifeſt that the dutie of preaching, is a duty of farre greater moment, then the dutie of performing fit Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or of refuſing inconuenient Ceremonies, ſuch as they pretend ours are, or the like. Firſt, becauſe the dutie of preaching the Goſpel, is a matter ſimply good in nature, but the refuſing of ſuch Ceremonies as ours are, ſuppoſing them to be inconuenient, or the practiſe of other Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in their ſteede ſuppoſing them to bee more fit, is a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring about matters in their nature ſimply indifferent, as before is manifeſt, and after appeareth further, ſo that in this caſe there is a refuſall, of a thing ſimply good, as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word, and propagation of the Goſpel. Secondly, becauſe the dutie of preaching the Goſpel, is a ſubſtantiall externall worſhip of God: the dutie of vſing fit Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or of refuſing vnfit (ſo they be not impious) is a matter ceremoniall, and circumſtantiall: For the Ceremonies are but circumſtances, tending to the better performance of the ſubſtantiall worſhippes, and doe ſerue thoſe ſubſtantiall worſhips of God: that is, they muſt be ſo ordered, as they may beſt ſerue to edifie, and further the ſubſtantiall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of God, and meanes of edification. Wherefore to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit preaching, is the violation of a dutie ſubſtantiall, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18363:29"/> conforming to inconuenient Ceremonies, is but the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a dutie circumſtantiall. It is better ſuffering an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward handmaide in the houſe, then by thruſting out the handmaide, to thruſt the miſtreſſe out of dores. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe preaching the word is a dutie particularly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word: but the dutie of the practiſe of fit Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or of refuſing the practiſe of vnfit (ſo they bee not ſimply and in nature euill) is included onely vnder generall rules of neceſſitie, of edification, expediencie, &amp;c. Fourthly, becauſe the dutie of preaching is preſſed on the Church, as a dutie perpetuall to the worlds end, Matth. 28. 19. 20. till we all meete, Epheſ. 4. 11. 12. till the appearing of Chriſt. 1. Tim. 6. 14. But the performance of Ceremonies are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, as appeareth by the frequent and lawfull variation of them: as in the chang of the time of the Lords ſupper from night to morning aboliſhing of the kiſſe of loue: and of the feaſt of charitie; ſometimes in ſome Church Ceremonies burdenſome and ſcandalous are needefully impoſed and practiſed as Iewiſh rites by the Apoſtles: ſometimes in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, others more needfull and they pernitious, Galath. 2. 3. 5. and 4. 9. 10. and 5. 2. Colloſſ. 2. 20. 21. Beſides all Churches differ in their Ceremonies one from another, and that in ſuch like Ceremonies as ours are: The Primitiue from the reformed, and all among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſome vſing more, others leſſe conuenientrites and ceremonies. But the preaching of the Goſpel, which giueth life and being to the Church, is perpetuall and vniforme for the ſubſtance thereof in all true Churches of all times and places; They all agree therein. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Becauſe the preaching of the Word, is an eſſentiall and inſeparable marke of the true Church, without the which a Church cannot conſiſt, fit ceremonies are no marke of the Church, neither doe vnfit and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ouerthrow the being thereof: and to this I adde that by continuance of preaching (by which the Church is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and vpholden) the danger of the ceremonies, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18363:30"/> it would be preuented and auoyded by the purity of doctrine: but the purity of ceremonies, or the refuſing inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient ceremonies will not counteruaile the loſſe of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching. Corrupt ceremonies deface the wals, &amp; perhaps may in time impaire ſome part of the out houſe: But the nullity of preaching ouerthroweth the whole Church, walls, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering, ornament, foundation, and all.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Becauſe the preaching of Gods Word is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of new birth, faith, hope, and of all grace, and finall ſaluation, 1. Cor. 1. 21. 1. Tim. 4. 16. Rom. 10. 15. 17. Eph. 4. 12. Fit Ceremonies are no ſuch meanes, neither do vnfit Ceremonies deſtroy the power &amp; efficacy thereof.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, Becauſe the dutie of preaching is ſimply ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, both in reſpect of Gods particular command, and alſo in reſpect of the preacher, who is attended with a woe if he neglect, 1. Cor. 9. 16. Hoſ. 4. 6. and in reſpect of the people who are ordinarily by this meanes gathered, edified and ſaued, Epheſ. 4. 11, 12, 1. Cor. 1. 21, and doe periſh if they haue it not, Prou. 29. 18, Hoſ. 4. 6. But the vſing of conuenient Ceremonies is not ſimply neceſſarie, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> for the ſake of preaching to further and vphold it, in which reſpect ſcandelous and dangerous cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies may be neceſſary to be inioyned and practiſed, Act. 15. 28. 29. And with inconuenient and hurtful Ceremonies, a Church may be a true church (as the Apoſtolical Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> was, as the moſt part of primitiue churches were, and of reformed Churches vſing far worſe ceremonies then ours are pretended to be:) Alſo a Chriſtian may haue the being of a true Chriſtian, &amp; may ſo remaine ſtanding in the true practiſe of faith, repentance, loue, patience, &amp;c. and in the aſſurance of his election, adoption, iuſtification, and in that ſtate may finally be ſaued, albeit hee liue and die in the practiſe of as euill ceremonies as ours are ſuppoſed; who if he ſhould continue without the meanes of preaching, the Word might haue great cauſe to doubt of all.</p>
            <p>Eightly, Becauſe of their ſubordination, for Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18363:30"/> (as before is noted) and the determination of them doe ſerue the ordinance of preaching the Word, and are by the Church to be determined, as may beſt ſerue for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance thereof, ſo they be not formally &amp; in their nature impious, in which reſpects (as before is ſaid) it may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to admit of very inconuenient, and accidentally hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ceremonies namely for the furtherance of the Goſpel, &amp; edification of the church: Elſe the Apoſtles by direction of the holy Ghoſt, ſinned in their doctrine and practiſe. But the ordinance of preaching doth at no time ſerue fit Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, neither ſhould giue place by laboring againſt vnfit.</p>
            <p>Thus from the nature, now from their effects it doth in like ſort appeare, that the duty of preaching tieth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience with a farre greater bond, then the duty of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the preſcribed Ceremonies. Firſt on the better part: The benefit of preaching the Word is incomparably grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then the benefit of auoyding theſe or the like inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Ceremonies. By the preaching of the Word, the Church hath name and being, yea, though Ceremonies, as is noted, be very inconuenient, and doe remaine in the Church as timber, hay, and ſtuble vpon Chriſt the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Ceremonies be they euer ſo well ordered without preaching, are of no force to giue name or being to the Church. Now farre greater is the Churches being, the progreſſe and liberty of the Goſpell, the publike vſe of the meanes of new birth, faith and ſaluation, and the viſibility of Chriſt his kingdome vpon earth, then the auoyding of offence, and ſuch other inconueniences accidentall, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent, neither purpoſed by Ceremonies in their nature not euill, but meerely indifferent: the one bringing a publike good to the whole Church, the inconuenience of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but priuate to a few, who take offence, and in this caſe by their owne default. Beſides experience ſheweth, how God hath proſpered multitudes of latter times, that haue entred by conformitie in euery place, and ſuch who ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in their places haue with a grounded conſcience, not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18363:31"/> by ſiniſter reſpects conformed to preuent their depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to redeeme it being loſt: The Lord hath done as much good by them, as by any Miniſter depriued, by the conuerſion, confirmation, conſolation, reclamation, exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, edification, I ſay not refuſing Ceremonies, ſpeaking againſt Biſhops, pleading for Church diſcipline, but in the maine doctrines and duties of ſauing grace and goodneſſe: Gods bleſsing hath beene on them as much as euer before, the Papiſts and enemies of righteouſneſſe haue beene no leſſe vexed and conuinced; yea Saints no leſſe comforted and confirmed; the Church no leſſe fortified, and the truth of the Goſpell no leſſe propagated if not much more. And the reaſon hereof is plaine: becauſe experience ſheweth, that the Church is not builded vp, but deſtroied rather, afflicted conſciences nothing quieted, but troubled rather, doubtful mindes not ſetled, but diſtracted rather, zealous mindes not rectified but diſordered rather, Papiſts and Browniſts not wonne or conuinced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather driuen further backe by the doctrine, practiſe, &amp; endleſſe diſputations of diſcipline, ceremonies, conſtitution of Churches, and the like: but by the ſound doctrine &amp; eſſentiall practiſe of repentance from dead works, faith in Chriſt, loue, patience, and good works, which ſauing points of the miſtery of godlineſſe are more taught and better practiſed by ſimple hearts, when the ſtumbling blockes of theſe leſſe pertinent queſtions (as Mint and Cummin in reſpect of Mercy and Iudgement) are remoued, or more ſparingly and peaceably debated.</p>
            <p>Secondly, on the worſer part: The miſchiefe, offence, and inconuenience of the Miniſters depriuation, for not conforming to the Ceremonies, ſeemeth in reaſon, and hath appeared in experience, to bee more by many degrees, then the ſcandall, and inconueniences ariſing of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to redeeming of their preaching, which thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth;</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Papiſtes doe more reioyce, the Godly are much more grieued, the Libertines doe much more tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18363:31"/> and ſo are like to doe (as they haue all more cauſe) to behold the Goſpel interrupted, the trueth obſcured, the Church weakened, the Miniſters of God throwne out, the flocke of Chriſt ſcattered, and the viſible kingdome of Chriſt diuided and deſſolued, then they would be to behold ſome inconuenient Ceremonies: theſe greater things of the law remaining entire, whereby Antichriſt and ſinne is dayly diſcouered and waſted; and by the which trueth and pietie, doe more encreaſe and preuaile. Admit that by inconuenient Ceremonies, the Church ſhould bee blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the conſciences of many ſcandalized: yet in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuation of teachers, without ſupply of as good, the Church of God tendeth to deſſolution, and vtter ruine: yea the ſoules of all the people are endangered to periſh. Prouerb. 29. 18. Hoſ. 4. 6. Math. 15. 14. For without the preaching of the worde, there is no publique ordinary meanes of ſaluation left: and ſo by conſequence no ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes of the hope of ſaluation, though all both Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and people, ſhould abſtaine from theſe inconuenient Ceremonies: Wheras ſo long as the word and Goſpel preached doeth remaine, Chriſt the foundation doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, both in ſound and doctrine, 1. Cor. 3. 11. Ephe. 2. 20. as alſo in aſſured preſence, Matth. 18. 20. and 28. 20. the infinite value of whoſe blood clenſeth from all ſin, 1. Ioh. 1. 7. and 5, 12, howſoeuer the ſtubble of corrupt doctrine, &amp; Ceremonies do remaine withall, and ſo the Church, both Miniſter, and people retaining and laying hold, on the foundation may bee ſaued, though as by fire, 1. Cor. 3. 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, experience teacheth vs, what a decay of grace, and backe ſliding of many moſt forward profeſſors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, what increaſe of Popery, and all prophaneneſſe in euery corner of the Land, and euen in ſundry of the places, where the depriued Miniſters were placed, haue enſued this their ſuffering of themſelues, to be thus put beſides their Miniſtrie.

And further to this end, it may be profitably noted, what degrees of grace doe appeare in ſuch as are violently carried this way: ſurely it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene, that the more eager people are againſt the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and for reformed diſcipline, their zeale is ſo exerciſed, and their affections carried to things without them, as that they finde ſmall leaſure to looke into Gods kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them: their tongues, pennes, practiſe are carried this way together with their hearts, ſo that they commonly neglect mercy, iudgement, fidelitie, and loue of God, mortification of ſinne, moderation of affections, holy guidance of the tongue, fruites of loue, and conſcience in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18363:32"/> their walking before men, and are brought at laſt ſo neere vnto their practiſe, who were taxed by our Sauiour that they can hardly eſcape their reproofe, viz. To ſtraine at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Cammell. Let the Browniſts and ſuch as draw neere vnto them, witneſſe for themſelues, both in their owne practiſe and report of faithfull witneſſes, and in the diſmall proceedings of ſuch fierie ſpirits, whom Arianiſme, Familiſme, Anabaptiſme, Libertiſme, or plaine prophaneneſſe haue ſwallowed and vndone at laſt. For it is a true maxime in Theologie, That when men beſtowe more zeale vpon circumſtantialls or ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, matter right or wrong, one way or another, for them or againſt them, then they doe vpon ſubſtantialls, they are vndoubtedly ſetled in the high way to hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie.

A man may breake the Sabboth (It is our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours phraſe) in ſome reſpects, and yet be blameleſſe before God, Mat. 12. 5. A man may doe that in ſome caſe, which by Gods Law is not lawfull for him (as our Sauiour Chriſt ſpeaketh) to doe, and yet bee innocent, Matth. 12. 3. A man may in ſome caſes performe ſome circumſtances in a ſubſtantiall worſhip of God, not as it is written, and yet performe that worſhip in Gods acceptation, and with his bleſſing, 2. Chron. 30. 18, 19, 20, 21, 25, 26. A man may in ſome caſe practiſe lawfully and neceſſarily, Act. 15. 19, 20. ſuch Ceremonies, which in ſome other caſes to practiſe were impotent and beggarly rudiments, Gal. 4. 9. will worſhips, traditions, commandements, and doctrines of men, Colloſ. 2. 20, 21, 22, 23. and in many maine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, euill and vnlawfull. Againe, vnto the Apoſtles ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I further ſay, that a man may bee ſayde to doe ſome euill to doe ſome good. Which anſwere will appeare out of the ſayde places; For to breake the Sabboth was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, yet to breake the Sabboth in ſome duetie, to further a greater duetie in Gods worſhip, which was good, made the Prieſts blameleſſe. To doe a thing not lawfull was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, yet to preſerue life, which is good, made <hi>Dauid</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent before God. To performe Gods worſhip not as it was written, was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and a ſinne: yet to further Gods ſubſtantiall worſhips, which was a good thing, was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of God. To practiſe antiquated, and ſuperannua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, vnprofitable, yea very hurtfull Ceremonies was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: yet to purchaſe the libertie of the Goſpell, and vnitie of brethren, which was good, made their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe good and neceſſary. So that this rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle muſt bee limited, and in ſome caſes holdeth not: for that as wee ſee a man may bee ſayde to doe
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18363:34"/> ſome euill, that ſome greater good may come thereof; the reaſon whereof is included in the foregoing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſumme whereof is this; Becauſe the relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing of obedience to a leſſer duty leaueth to be a ſinne, when a greater duety commeth in place, which yet were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill if the greater duety were abſent. As for example, to violate ſacrifice, (namely to breake the Sabbath by rubbing eares of corne: to eate that which is expreſly forbidden him of God, and ſo to doe a thing not lawfull) is noe ſinne, when mercy and neceſſity comes in place, which if mercy or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperior worke and duety were away, were ſinne. In a word a man may doe a thing euill in vſe, circumſtance, and by accident, ſo it be not ſimply and in nature euill: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a man may violate a duety ceremoniall to further or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh a morrall good thing, in which caſe the euill of the action ceaſeth, and this was the Apoſtles in the practiſe of the Iewiſh ceremonies. <label type="milestone">

            <p>Firſt the degrees; Secondly, the ſubordination of duties commanded in the Law of God. Conſider firſt, that there are degrees of duties of both Tables of the Law, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in reaſon: for there are duties ſubſtantiall, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties circumſtantiall. Subſtantiall duties are both internall of the firſt Table, as loue, knowledge, feare, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God: of the ſecond Table, as loue, reuerence, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, kindneſſe, compaſſion, iuſtice, &amp;c. Subſtantiall externall alſo of the firſt Table, ſtandeth in the maine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of inuocation, preaching, and hearing of the Word, receiuing of the Scraments, lawfull ſwearing, &amp;c. Of the ſecond Table, as outward reuerence, obedience, helpe, and tribute to ſuperiours, kindneſſe and thankfulneſſe ſhewed to equalls, almes, reward, correction, and inſtruction to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours: The circumſtantiall duties of either Table are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall circumſtances, actions, or Ceremonies, for the more orderly, fit, and decent performance of the ſubſtantialls: as obſeruation of fit time, as either night or day, and this or that houre, in either place publike or priuate, ſite of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as ſitting, ſtanding, kneeling, high or low, ſinging, ſaying, and the like. The which degrees, and differences of duties are thus diſtinguiſhed vnto vs by the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, who hath taught vs to ſeuer the loue of God, a ſubſtantiall of the firſt Table, and iudgement, mercy, fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, ſubſtantialls of the ſecond Table, from the tithing of mint, cummin, anniſſe, rue, and all manner of hearbes, a ceremoniall Law, which yet was a duty being comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and muſt be done, calling the one ſort of duties, the weightier matters of the Law, Matthew 12. 23. Luk. 11. 43. ſeparating them by that title, from the other which muſt be leſſe weightie, or (as they called) the leſſer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, Matthew 25. 19. Calling the one mercy, the other ſacrifice, Matthew 12. 7. the one, the knowledge of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18363:37"/> God, the other burnt offerings, Hoſea 6. 6. the one Gods kingdome, the other not ſo, Rom. 14. 17. betweene the which he teacheth vs to put as much difference, as betweene a Cammell, and a Gnat, Matth. 23. 23. 24. himſelfe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the former without the latter, Marke 16. 15. 16. but not the latter without the former: tying the promiſe of ſaluation ſimply to the greateſt, but not to the inferiour without the greater. Conſider that there is a ſubordination of theſe duties of the Law (whereof there are theſe forena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med degrees) as namely, that the greater duties, ſuch as haue in them greateſt reaſon and band, doe tye the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, doe ouerrule the leſſer, and command obedience with the neglect of the other for that preſent, when they meete together. So as the neglect of the leſſer leaueth to bee a ſinne, for the performance of the greater: as the neglect of obeyſance to a noble man, or inferiour perſon is no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in preſence of a King: and this ſubordination is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to all the duties of the Law, except the ſupremeſt of all other, then which there is none higher; as the higheſt duties vnto God, feare, loue, confidence, repentance, which muſt neuer be commanded &amp; ouerruled by other duties inferior, whatſoeuer they be: and the reaſon is, becauſe the ſupremacy of God, and the immediate proximity betweene theſe duties and God: which alſo in reſpect of the immutable nature, &amp; attributes of God, which muſt leaue to be God, and deny his titles of iuſtice, of mercy, goodneſſe, truth, &amp;c. if hee ſhould diſpence with them.

The former ouerrules the latter, by the reaſon yeelded by our Sauiour, That the Sabbaoth was made for man, and not man for the Sabbaoth, Mark. 2. 27, and it is lawfull (though violating ceremoniall reſt) to doe morrally well vpon the Sabbaoth, Matthew 12. 12, for in theſe caſes God will haue mercy and not ſacrifice.</p>

It was vnlawfull in the law for the Prieſtes to admit, or for the people to come vnto the Sacraments, otherwiſe then as it was written, though the failing was but a ceremoniall matter: yet ſo did the people come, and the Prieſtes admit the people in the time of <hi>Hezekias,</hi> that the ſubſtantiall worſhip of God in the Paſſeouer ſhould not bee hindred: In which reſpect God layed not the breach of dutie to the charge of ſuch as ſought God in that Sacraments with their whole heart, 2.

Chro. 15. 16. for the better explication of this rule, and to ſee how farre it holdeth, and how ſmally it concernes our caſe, I ſay firſt, that this rule holds in the duties of the firſt table, which forbides ſinne which by no circumſtance can be amended,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18363:40"/> but are formally euill, and in nature, and oppoſite to the puritie and immutability of Gods nature, as in theſe, Haue none other gods, Commit not Idolatry, Take not Gods name in vaine. There is no time, or occaſion, or duety ſuperior, wherein a man may violate the precepts, they are ſempiternally, and irreuocably inuiolable, without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Duties alſo of the ſecond table, as reſiſt not the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate Rom. 13. 2. deſpiſe not thy parents. Prou. 23. 22. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not murther, commit not adulterie, ſteale not, beare not falſe witneſſe, couet not, neither may theſe duties in any caſe bee, or for any ſuperior reaſon violated: neither haue they beene heretofore broken, but onely in a caſe of exception, and that is of Gods ſpeciall command. For in this caſe the common rule holdeth: That a particular command of God vnto one perſon or more ouer rules a generall; In which caſe the ſubſtantiall negatiues of the ſecond table, doe yeeld to the ſubſtantiall affirmatiues of the firſt, as being all ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the loue of God: As the particular command of God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to kill and offer his ſonne <hi>Iſaack,</hi> Gen. 22. 10. 12. ouerrules the generall command of God, Thou ſhalt doe no murther: and in <hi>Abraham</hi> it was no murther, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that command which elſe had beene. The particular command of God to <hi>Iehu,</hi> if not <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 1. Kin. 11. 35, 37, 38, and 12. 24. to ſmite the houſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> his maſter, the Queene, and the blood royall. 2. Kin. 9. 6, 7, 9, 10, &amp; 10, 15, 16, 17, 30. which elſe had beene vtterly vnlawfull for him to doe. So Gods particular command vnto the Iſraelites to borrow that of the Egyptians, which they neuer paid and ſo ſpoyling them, Ex. 3. 22, and 11. 2. and 12. 35. ouerſwayd the general command, Thou ſhalt not ſteale, which elſe had bin theft in them. Alſo the particular command of God vnto the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> not to mourne for his dead and moſt deere wife, Eze. 24. 15, 16, 17, 18. which elſe had beene argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed want of naturall affection. I will not giue inſtance of Gods particular command to <hi>Hoſea,</hi> cap. 1. 2. to marry a wife of fornications, becauſe the place is otherwiſe interpreted by

King. 20. 35, 36, 37. In which caſe it was no ſinne to ſmite and wound the innocent Prophet, and it was a good worke of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſmite him, which without the particular command of God, had beene a ſinne. Secondly, this rule holdes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting in a caſe of ſimple neceſſitie: In which reſpect, it was lawfull for <hi>Paul</hi> to caſt the wheate into the Sea, though otherwiſe it were not good to doe it, Mat. 15. 26. and for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> to ſpare <hi>Ioab</hi> the murtherer, in a caſe of neceſſity, becauſe he was too hard for him: alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> command for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of diuorce, is heereby iuſtified, for the hardneſſe of the Iewes hearts, a caſe of neceſſitie: Alſo the Apoſtles pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing and practiſing the Iewiſh Ceremonies was vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but in a caſe of neceſſitie: of like nature, is <hi>Dauids</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Shew-bread, the Apoſtles rubbing of the eares of Corne: vnder this kinde commeth the lawfull vſe of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ſcandalous things, ouerruled by neceſſitie: and ſo is the conformity vnto the Ceremonies preſcribed, made lawfull, for all the negatiue prohibitions, whether one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this caſe of neceſſitie. Thirdly, this rule holdeth alſo in matters circumſtantiall and ceremoniall, excepting when a ſuperior duety meetes with them, to ouerrule them: of this kind is the caſe of <hi>Dauids</hi> eathing Shew-bread, and the Apoſtles practiſing and preſcribing Iewiſh Ceremonies, for the Churches peace and furtherance of the Goſpel: which hade not elſe beene lawfull to haue done, and here is alſo an image of our caſe. Here it is demanded, whether an affima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue ſubſtantiall of the firſt table, meeting with a negatiue circumſtantiall of the firſt table, the former doeth ouerrule the latter? I anſwere yea: For ſuch were the former caſes of <hi>Dauids</hi> eating the Shew-bread, of the Apoſtles practiſe of Moſaicall Ceremonies, and the like. By this alſo we haue an anſwere againſt the objection; That we may lawfully omit
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18363:42"/> good, to doe ſome ſuperior duety, or to omit good for a time, to preuent a miſchiefe of ſinne, or harme to others or our ſelues: as to conceale a trueth to ſaue ones life, or to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit preaching, to quench an houſe on fire. But we may not commit an euill, to purchaſe or procure any good. Which obiection is both vntrue, for <hi>Dauids</hi> eating Shew-bread, the Apoſtles practiſing of Iewiſh, ſcandalous, and hurtful Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and the like inſtances before rehearſed, were mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of commiſſion, not of omiſſion, and beſides, this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection is incident into the former: For omiſſion is of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties affirmatiue, and commiſſion is againſt duties negatiue.</p>

            <p>Becauſe the ſwaying againſt the iudgement and practiſe <note place="margin">VIII.</note> of all Churches and Teachers, is againſt the equity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny forcible and maine reaſons: For:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:18363:50"/> 1 Who are more likely to know the trueth, euen in ſuch a point as this, then the whole company of ſuch? Firſt, who are indued with the moſt excellent gifts in the Church, and greateſt degrees of knowledge and vnderſtanding of Gods word, and with meanes tending thereunto? doe not the beſt ſights, beſt iudge of colours? Secondly, who are and haue been endued with greateſt degrees of euident ſanctity? Thirdly, whoſe labours haue beene moſt of all bleſſed of God, for the conuerſion of ſoules, for the ouerthrow of ſinne, and Antichriſt, and Hereſies? Fourthly, who haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and died moſt comfortably in the Lord? If a man ſhould not reſt in the iudgements of the whole company of ſuch, where ſhould he reſt? or what peace or aſſurance ſhall hee haue to haue all theſe (ſo many as all and ſo incomparable perſons) his aduerſaries: as in condemning ſuch for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and falſe Teachers.</p>
            <p n="2">2 No one point of error can be ſhewed, which is eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by this rule: namely, by the conſent of iudgement and practiſe of all Churches, primitiue, and reformed latter. For albeit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome faithfull perſons, and ſome true Churches, may differ from ſome other in ſundry points, and thereby there muſt needes bee error in one part or other: yet it were hard for a few priuate perſons, to conuince them all of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, in a matter wherein they all agree: if they were in errour; is it not ſtrange, no age ſhould bee able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne it?</p>
            <p n="3">3 Such as haue wilfully and profeſſedly differed from this rule, haue beene found to haue beene New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fangles, Heretickes, Schiſmatickes, and prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; ſuch as Donatiſts, Anabaptiſts, Browniſts, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Fameliſts, and the like: and are of infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, one from another, and therefore all, or the very moſt, muſt needes bee an errour, for there is but one trueth.</p>
            <p n="4">4 By the reiecting of this rule, euery Sect maketh a way open to their owne contempt. For if the iudgement
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18363:50"/> of ſo reuerend, and ſo excellent lights and agreement of them all, is to bee deſpiſed and reiected by any particular: why ſhould not others reiect and contemne them and their iudgement, the matter being difficult, and of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, and themſelues being ſo many thouſand degrees behind the perſon whom they thus deſpiſe, in their worth or number?</p>
            <p n="5">5 It opens a doore to ſingularitie, noueltie, and of endleſſe differences, errors and contentions, and leaues no rule of Peace, or of ending diſſentions in the Church of God: For if one may vnder colour of trueth, teach and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe what he liſt in his diuerſitie: why may not another do the like? or what rule will there be, to compoſe the diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that doe and will ariſe in the Church! which one part hauing the trueth, may vrge vnto the other voyd of truth: why ſhould hee rather follow this part then that? wherefore in this caſe wee are to note, that no priuate perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, may raiſe vp any new opinion, and pretend Scripture for it, and ſo propoſe it for a Doctrine and a truth in the Church, though hee condemne the whole Church beſide for an error and a ſinne. Becauſe as the Scriptures are not of priuate interpretation, ſo Gods Spirit is not priuate, but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to all the faithfull.</p>
            <p>Thus wee ſee this doctrine of ſwaying againſt all true Churches and Teachers of all ages and places, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them of ſinne and error, is falſe doctrine. Whereupon alſo it followeth ſecondly, that it is a ſinne: which alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth further.</p>
            <p>I Becauſe Dauid doth iudge himſelfe that he treſpaſſed, in that he being a priuate man condemned and cenſured all the generation of Gods children, Pſal. 73. 13. 14. 15. Againe becauſe God laieth a woe vpon the practiſe of taking away the righteouſneſſe of the righteous from him, Eſa. 5. 23. or of condemning the iuſt, Pr. 17. 15. But that doctrine &amp; practiſe which laieth a ſin vnto the charge of all Gods Church, takes away their righteouſnes and condemnes them in that point.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18363:51"/> Therefore it is a ſinne, euen of bearing falſe witneſſe againſt the whole congregation of neighbours.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Becauſe the cenſuring of all true Churches, for a ſin, or of falſe Doctrine, is contrary to the Commandements of God: who would haue the Teachers obeyed and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened vnto, which doe teach and define <hi>ſecundum legem:</hi> as aboue I noted, Heb. 13. 17. Deut. 17. 9, 10, 11, 12. and would haue the reſt to iudge of the words of a few which prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, 1. Cor. 14. 29. 32. and of the commandement, of walking in the wayes of good men, Pro. 2. 20. Phil. 3. 17. and 4. 9. It is alſo contrary to the practiſe of the holy Apoſtles, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined one Churches differences by another, Act. 15. 2. as before I noted.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Becauſe this Doctrine is the ground, and mother of ſchiſme: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> noteth, that they cauſe diuiſion and offences, that teach and practiſe contrary to the doctrine which the whole Church hath receiued eſpecially from the Apoſtles, Rom. 16. 17. Therefore this doctrine is a ſinne.</p>

All which our Church with all other reformed Churches doe vtterly diſclaime, and are free from: and namely in preſcribing and vſing of theſe ceremonies, or the like, as appeareth by conſidering; Firſt, the matter which is taught, which is of two ſorts, ſome things are fundamentall and of greater moment, ſome things circumſtantiall and of leſſer: againe ſome things are ſpecially commaunded, others included vnder generall rules and are left free to euery Church to bee determined, as ſhall beſt ſerue for the edification there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſometimes after one manner, and at other times after ſome other: where we are to obſerue that our Church (as other reformed Churches) doe teach nothing fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, which is not expreſly taught in the Word, neither doth it teach any thing contrary to that which is expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt in his Word; onely it varieth the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantialls or ceremonialls, according to the liberty left vnto all Churches, and practiſed by all Churches, which the gouernours doe ſuppoſe beſt to further or edifie the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantialls.

In which caſe our Church cannot bee ſaide to deny Chriſt for her onely teacher and Prophet, but rather to confeſſe him, ſeeing ſhee teacheth nothing but that Chriſt hath commanded.

                  <p>Some were deceiued by Heretickes, who to couer their pernicious hereſies, did ſtudiouſly broach traditions vnder the Apoſtles names and authoritie, ſo did <hi>Artemon, Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lides, Valentius, Marcion, Euſebius</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Clemens Strom. lib.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>And thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> is noted to haue been deceiued by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> his <hi>Paraclet.</hi> and inſpiration, as appeareth in his booke <hi>de veland. virgin.</hi>

                  <p>Some are noted to haue aſcribed too too much vnto traditions: So did <hi>Papias, Clemens, Origen</hi> and they cite Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphall booke to countenance them, and commend very ſory matters, both of doctrine and of practiſe to themſelues
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18363:59"/> and others.

                  <p>Some of the ancient Biſhops, gouerning at ſeuerall times, in diuers places, did commend the traditions, which they liked or fancied themſelues, to their poſterities for lawes.

                  <p>Some of the Fathers did bring in the Ceremonies with no ſuperſtition or opinion of merit, or neceſſitie, but with a good intention; namely, to ſtirre vp the more reuerence and admiration towards the Sacraments, and to ſtirre vp a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:18363:59"/> kind of deuotion in the minds of men: which going fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further, and increaſing, tooke ſtrength vntill at laſt they turned to that manifeſt impiety, idolatry, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, as wee ſee in that ſuppoſed Church of <hi>Rome</hi> this day, <hi>Zepperus de Politia eccl. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. <hi>fol</hi> 55.</p>

                  <p>Some of the Ceremonies were brought in vpon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as the ſigning of a mans ſelfe with the Croſſe, which was vſed on occaſion of the Pagans mocking of the Chriſtians crucified God, that they might teſtifie vnto them, that they were Chriſtians, and not aſhamed of the Croſſe of Chriſt: this Martyr <hi>Loc. claſſ.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. §. 20. noteth out of <hi>Auguſtine,, de verbis Apostoli ſer.</hi> 8. which after grew to ſuperſtition.

                  <p>All, or the very moſt part of theſe their ceremonies, were <hi>ſignificatiue,</hi> as before appeares; many of them in the euent were holden <hi>opperatiue,</hi> ſuch as the impoſition of hands, ſigne of the croſſe, anointing with oyle, <hi>Tertullian de reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectione carnis.

                  <p>That this cenſure of the man, was done in exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue heate, or in a pelting chafe on his part, as <hi>Socrates</hi> affirmeth, 5. 22. that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> Biſhop of Lions, did put <hi>Victor</hi> in remembrance of his duety, <hi>Euſebius</hi> 5. 24 ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooued him, <hi>ibidem,</hi> and bitterly inueighed againſt him, and conteſted with him by letters, <hi>Socrates</hi> 5. 22. that all the Eaſterne Biſhops ſtill kept their old by as from the Romiſh Sea, for all the threates of <hi>Victor,</hi> euen vnto the time of the <hi>Nicaene</hi> Council, when all agreed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any abſolution at all, from <hi>Victors</hi> thunder-clappe, yea that <hi>Policrates,</hi> the preſident of the Eaſterne Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and all the reſt which were very many, were

                  <p>Firſt what a feeble Primacy, the Pope had in thoſe times, beſides his poſſibilities and actuality of erring, euen in <hi>Catheàra</hi> being ſo countermaunded reprooued, and diſobeyed, by ſuch incomparable Churches, and teachers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, how dangerouſly the Papiſts put the iumpe of all their ſempiternall expectations vppon the credit, euen of the greateſt clerkes, which ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truely, falſly, and corruptly relate the recordes of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity.</p>
                  <p>Next, for the effect and abuſe of theſe things in the people, wee may eaſily ſee that if the fountaines bee troubled the ſtreames cannot bee cleere, as may appeare by that which followeth.</p>
                  <p>Many things commaunded in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and of very holſome and good vſe, were leſſe reſpected and cared for, then many light matters, whereof they ouerbouldly preſumed, <hi>Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Many of them neglected and ſwallowed great things, placing opinion of religion, and ſhewing great diligence in following or practiſing ſuch things as had in them ſmall profit, <hi>Hieronymus. in Mattheum cap.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Many of them were obſerued to bee troubleſome to others by being caried on with a contentious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, others by a ſuperſtitious timorouſneſſe about ſuch trifles, as neither were comfirmed, by authority of the holy Scripture, nor by the cuſtome of the Church in generall, neither ſerued for any profit to the amendment of life and manners, <hi>Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>As for example they were very ſuperſtitious and preciſe
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18363:61"/> in bearing about certaine little peeces of the Goſpels: and of the wood of the croſſe. &amp; <hi>iſtiuſmodi rebus,</hi> and in the like things, and <hi>vſque bodié factitant,</hi> doing it euen to that day, hauing the zeale of God, but not according to knowledge, ſtraining at a gnat and ſwallowing a Cammell, <hi>Hieron.</hi> in <hi>Matt. cap.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>They were maruelous preciſe in their faſtings; for on their faſting dayes, they would eate no oile nor bread, but figges, pepper, nutts, dates, flower, hony, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtachia, all herbes and fruits growing in the garden <hi>(&amp; delicias)</hi> and other delicates, they would not drinke water, but they would haue inſtead thereof, <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiunculas delicatas:</hi> delicate ſuppings, and the Iuice of herbes preſſed out, and that not in a cup, but in the ſhell of a Sea-fiſh: they ſought <hi>famam abſtinentiae, in delitijs,</hi> commendation of their abſtinence, by vſing, delicates: <hi>Hierom.</hi> calleth theſe things, <hi>ineptiae: ſuperstitiones: Ieiunium ſuperſtitioſum in Epiſt. ad Neapot.</hi>

                  <p>They cenſured ſuch as dined on the Sabbath ſoberly, and did not faſt as the manner of ſome places was: that namely they were in the fleſh, and could not pleaſe God; that they were wicked perſons, belly mongers, and that they ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the fleſh, and of death, and their voice was this, <hi>rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant a me iniqui, viam eorum eſſe nolo,</hi> and they ſeparated from them, <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 86. <hi>ad Caſulanum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They would not ſerue God in a temple once abuſed to Idolatry, neither eate any herbes growing in the garden, nor drinke any water running from the fountaine of an Idoll-temple, <hi>Idem Epiſt.</hi> 154. <hi>Publicol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They would more ſharpely reprooue a man <hi>(qui per octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uas ſuas terram nudo pede tetigerit)</hi> Who during the time of their <hi>octaues,</hi> ſhould touch the ground with his bare feete, then a man which was with wine ſtarke drunke, <hi>Idem Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.</p>
                  <p>Some of them did abſteine from eating fleſh, with ſuch a mind, as that they iudged thoſe perſons vncleane which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18363:61"/> did eat thereof: This <hi>Auguſtine</hi> writeth out of the report of <hi>Ianuar. Epiſt.</hi> 119. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. and giueth his cenſure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that namely, <hi>apertiſſimé contra fidem ſanam<expan>

                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, many of them, out of their owne fancies, or from the cuſtome of other places, did cauſe ſuch litigious queſtions about theſe matters vngrounded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and vnprofitable in their nature, that they thought no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing right, which they did not themſelues, <hi>Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>And thus in part, we ſee a ſmall glimſe of the ſtate of the Primatiue Church of Chriſt, which we commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count and is heere extended from the daies of the Apoſtles, vntil the time of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> or there about: For afterwards the ſame (which then was clouded) declined vnto darke night, and we will deſcend no lower, knowing that iuſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception might be taken at it in this argument.</p>
                  <p>Now in the next place we will giue a taſte of the doctrine and practiſe of the Fathers, and the faithfull in the middeſt of theſe corruptions, that we may ſee how the doctrine of ſuffering depriuation for inconuenient ceremonies (farre more for number, and worſe for qualitie then ours are pretended) hath by them beene propoſed and practiſed. Touching their doctrine of this point, thus they taught:</p>
                  <p>That the Apoſtles driftin their writings, was not to ſet downe Canons and Decrees concerning Feaſts and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies (or ſuch like Ceremonies of the Church) but to ſet downe a preſident of pietie, good life and godly conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Socrat.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
                  <p>Seeing there is no man able to ſhew any preſident or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in writing (of faſting daies or the like traditions) it is euident that the Apoſtles did leaue free choice and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to euery Church at the diſcretion thereof, without feare, compulſion, and conſtraint to vſe that which ſeemeth good and commendable for it ſelfe, <hi>ibid.</hi> the like doth <hi>Auguſtine, Epiſt.</hi> 86. ſpeake of faſting.</p>
                  <p>They obſerued three ſorts of Traditions or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18363:62"/> in the Churches of their times; Firſt, ſuch as Chriſt left to his Church, expreſly ſet downe in the Canonicall Scriptures, which <hi>Augustine</hi> calleth an eaſie yoke and light burthen, very few for the number, very eaſie for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, very excellent for ſignification (he mentioneth onely baptiſme and the Lords Supper) whereby hee hath knit together the ſociety <hi>noui Populi</hi> of the new Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, ſuch Traditions or Ceremonies in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their times, as are not written but deliuered, and are obſerued throughout the whole world, ſuppoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Apoſtles, or from the preſcription of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells (whoſe authority was wholeſome (quoth he) to be eſteemed of) ſuch as the dayes obſerued yeerely to the memoriall of Chriſt his paſſion, reſurrection, aſenſion, and deſcenſion of the holy Ghoſt, commonly called Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt or Whitſontide.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, ſuch as in diuers parts and places of the world are obſerued diuerſly, as for example, that ſome doe faſt on the Sabboth, others doe not ſo; ſome doe daily receiue the Communion, other receiue it on certaine dayes: In ſome places it is celebrated on all dayes without exception, other where onely on Saturne dayes, and on the Lords day: <hi>Et ſi quid aliud huiuſmodi animaduerti poteſt, totum hoc genus rerum liberas habet obſeruationes, August. Epiſt.</hi> 118. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Ianuar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there ought of neceſſity one faith to be ſpread ouer the whole Church, as the ſoule within the members, albeit this vnitie of faith, be celebrated and ſolemnized with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers obſeruations, by which diuerſity that which is true in the ſubſtance of faith, <hi>nullo modo impeditur,</hi> is no way hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred becauſe all the beautie of the Kings daughter is within: but the outward Ceremonies which are diuerſly obſerued, are as vpon her garment, <hi>Auguſt. Epiſt.</hi> 86.</p>
                  <p>That the difference and variety of faſtings, or of dayes obſerued in diuers Churches (or Ceremonies of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) doth not interrupt or impaire but commend the vnity
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18363:62"/> and conſonance of faith, ſo ſaith <hi>Irenaeus, Euſeb.</hi> 5. 24. the like is, <hi>in Diſtinct.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ſcit. Sancta.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That if their be any matter of this quality, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the grounded obſeruation of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; It muſt be reduced to the doctrine &amp; practiſe of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; againe, though their predeceſſours of ſimplicitie or ignorance had erred (which by Gods mercy might be pardoned to them) in which caſe men ought not to obſerue, what any man before them did thinke fit to be done, but what Ieſus Chriſt (who is farre before all) did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme himſelfe, <hi>Cypr.

               <p>Secondly therefore I will prooue the ſecond part of the aſſumption, namely, [that the doctrine and practiſe of leauing ones miniſterie by ſuffering depriuation for not conforming to the Ceremonies preſcribed, is oppoſite vnto the doctrine and practiſe of all true reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and teachers or all claſſicall writers.]</p>

                  <p>Touching their iudgement and cenſure of our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I find them in a threefold difference. For ſome of them doe approue ſundry of our controuerſed Ceremonies as fit and commendable. Some againe do iudge of many of them as of things indifferent, to bee vſed or not vſed, euen as the Church ſhall thinke fitteſt for it ſelfe. And laſtly, ſome there be who account them as things in many reſpects vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and inconuenient: but yet in reſpect of greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conueniences, (and namely of Depriuation) doe holde them tolerable and excuſable: which difference if any man be deſirous to make vſe of, he may diſcerne it in the reading and obſeruing of them ſeuerally.</p>
                  <p>In the iudgement, cenſure, and aduice of the godly lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned touching our Ceremonies, we may obſerue firſt, what they thought in generall of the Common prayer Booke of our Church, and of the Ceremonies therein contained.

If hee haue no more pure Miniſtrie in the place, or about the place of his aboade, or be driuen from the vſe thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his will; as now in theſe partes the communicating in the purer Churches is for bidden, to the orthodoxe vnder paine of proſcription. 2.

If before he come, he make confeſſion plainely, and ingenuouſly, without darkeneſſe, and doubtfulneſſe vnto the Miniſters, and know whether they will receiue him with this confeſſion, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him as a member of the Church, yeelding confeſſion of the trueth to others alſo, but profeſſe it before all, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him a reaſon of his faith, either in publike or in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate: If the Miniſter refuſe him on theſe conditions, let him abſtaine, if he admit him and there be obiected to him, and layed before him his practiſe <hi>(vitioſae Ceremoniae)</hi> corrupt Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, falſe opinions, ſcornings of the trueth by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries, as if hee ſhould be infected with ſome ſuperſtition thereby, and that hee giueth ſcandall hereby to the weake, which may ſuſpect that he approueth their opinions, and ſo may be confirmed alſo in theſe things. It is anſwered thus, that this is ſcandall taken, not giuen, if he who endureth this ſeruitude, inioying in the meane while his Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doeth not omit the confeſſion of the trueth vnto the Miniſters and others; and with all doe openly profeſſe for what cauſe, on what conditions, on what perſwaſion, and to what end hee communicateth, and in what different reckoning he holdeth the ordinances of Chriſt, and the traditions of men; for thus all iuſt cauſe of offence is taken away.</p>

So the Prophets &amp; other Saints in the old Teſtament, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the New, did vſe the Miniſtery of the Prieſts, which many waies did corrupt the doctrine &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God: but in the mean while they themſelues did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it ſelfe idolatrous or forbidden of God, but did ſharply reprehend the errors of the Phariſes &amp; Saduces: So <hi>Paul</hi> by the obſeruation of Iewiſh aboliſhed Ceremonies did apply himſelf vnto the weake, when they fled from him as from an enemie of the Law, and of their countrey Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, and in this thing did not ſinne. <hi>Peter</hi> applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto the Iewes alſo, and yet is reproued, we ſee, of <hi>Paul:</hi> The cauſe was becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> did adde, but <hi>Peter</hi> did omit the neceſſary confeſſion and doctrine of the trueth: Therfore <hi>Peter</hi> gaue ſcandall to the weake, and confirmed them that erred in their error, which <hi>Paul</hi> did not.

For as the word which is preached, although it be not to beadored, yet it is reuerently to be heard and handled, as the word, not of man, but as the word of God: So alſo the elements of the Sacraments, in the act of the adminiſtration of them are worthy of ſome reuerence and honour, as things not prophane, but holy,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:18363:86"/> and to this purpoſe is that where the Apoſtle commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the Bread to be eaten, and the Wine to be drunke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.

                  <p>In Geneua about Wafer-bread in the Lords Supper: This Church in the reformation thereof vſed common bread in the Lords Supper, and had aboliſhed the vſe of the Wafer-cake, as alſo their fontes to be baptiſed in, and all their holy dayes except the Lords day: Now it fell out that the Church of Berne aſſembling a Synod required a reſtoring of theſe things vnto the Churches of Geneua, <hi>Caluin.

                  <p>About an Altar: There is a hiſtory related of two great perſons, a Prince and an Earle, the one a Lutheran, the other a reformed Proteſtant. The Earle ſuppoſing that hee had more iuriſdiction in a certaine Church then the Prince had, commanded an Altar in the Church to bee pulled downe, and a table to be erected in the place: The Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran Prince vnderſtanding thereof, commanded the table to bee taken downe, and the Altar to bee againe ſet vp: The Earle repeated his practiſe the ſecond time, ſo did the Prince, at laſt the Earle (in a matter of that nature) let alone the Altar in the Church, &amp; ſuffered the contentious Prince to haue his will, <hi>Colloqu.

It was anſwered by the Synod, that they muſt remaine in the receiued cuſtome of the Belgicke Churches, and if any ſhould doe againſt the cuſtome, they muſt be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed to deſiſt and leaue of that their practiſe: <hi>In actis Syn. inferioris Germ. partic. interrogat. numb.</hi> 76. <hi>apud Schul.

                  <p>Becauſe if ſome things in their nature indifferent be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it is not meete too egerly to contend about ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; eſpecially when as we ſee thoſe Magiſtrates by whom the light of the Goſpel is much furthered in England, and by whoſe authority it may much more be furthered, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelues againſt vs. <hi>Peter Martyr ibid. fol.</hi> 1085. <hi>Hoopero.</hi>

                  <p>Becauſe, whereas the Miniſters are willing to reforme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, &amp; the Magiſtrate is peremptory and reſolute, not to reforme for ſome reaſons of policy, the Miniſter in that caſe is not to leaue his miniſtery, or to trouble the Church, <hi>intempeſtiuis clamoribus,</hi> or to conteſt or contend with the magiſtrate: The reaſon is, becauſe this courſe tendeth to the ouerthrow of the Church, and is oppoſite to that charity which he oweth vnto Chriſt &amp; to his church, out of which ground and rule he ought to preach, and to hold on in the courſe of his miniſtery. Hee ought indeede to teach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately (as the matter requireth) what is to be done, but this he muſt performe without ſedition and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the Church; but peaceably and diſcreetly.

                  <p>Becauſe the Apoſtles in this caſe being guided by the rule of loue, did at the inſtant requeſt of the Iewes, inioyne the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18363:96"/> Brethren, and the Churches which were gathered out of Gentiliſme, to abſtaine from ſtrangled meate and bloud; and choſe rather to burthen them for a ſeaſon with the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of theſe things which ſauoured of Iewiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. Alſo by the ſame rule of loue was <hi>Paul</hi> led whenas he came into the Temple with thoſe foure Iewes which had a vow vpon them, and purified himſelfe with them. Yet theſe Rites of thoſe times were <hi>(Stipulae cum fundamento Chriſto non co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruentes)</hi> Stubble not agreeing with Chriſt the foundation: But the edification of the Church required this thing. Wherefore many things are to be tolerated by the Miniſters, that the peace of Churches be not rent, and that Schiſmes may bee auoyded, ſo that they bee not ſuch things, or doctrines which doe fight with the foundation and doe heaue at it, <hi>Zanch. ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe if Paſtors cannot reforme all things which need amendment, according to their deſire, they muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore caſt away their Miniſtry, or trouble the whole Church with an vnvſuall aſperity. The reaſon: Becauſe all godly ground and forme of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline ought euer to haue reſpect and haue reference to the vnitie of the ſpirit in the bond of peace; which the Apoſtle commanded to bee kept by ſeruing one another; and which rule not being kept, the medicine of diſcipline groweth to be ſuperfluous, and pernicious. It is confeſſed, that Paſtors ought with their vttermoſt endeuours to labour, that there remaine no corruption in the Church: but they muſt vſe that wiſdome which our Sauiour preſcribeth, leſt by plucking vp the tares, they hurt the good corne. Wherefore the precept of the Apoſtle of ſeparating the euill, (or of mending corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) muſt by no meanes be neglected, <hi>cum ſine periculo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landae pacis fieri potest,</hi> when it may bee done without the danger of violation of the Churches peace: for elſe hee would not haue it done. <hi>Caluin. inſtit.</hi> 4. 12. §. 11. 13.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the charge of preaching the word of God is an abſolute commandement of the Lord; and it is ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18363:97"/> for him that is called thereunto, that a woe hangeth on his head if he doe not preach it: It ought not to be laid aſide for a ſimple inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience, or vncomlineſſe of a thing, which in its owne nature is indifferent; ſuch as the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſe is, whereof he ſpeaketh, or the like Ceremonies, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> in the reſt of the 2. reply, <hi>fol.</hi> 262. 263.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe when two commandements of the morall Law are oppoſite in reſpect of vs, ſo as we cannot doe them both at the ſame time; then the leſſer commandement (as auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding inconuenient Ceremonies) giues place to the greater, (ſuch as preaching of the Word) and doeth not binde for that inſtant, Maſter <hi>Perkins</hi> in his Treatiſe of conſcience, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>fol.</hi> 14. 15.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe it is euident that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord did onely preſcribe the ſubſtance of the Miniſtry both of the Word and Sacraments in his owne words; and all other things which appertaine to the decent and profitable adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his myſteries he hath left and admitted to be orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his Church: Hence wee celebrate the Lords Supper, neither in the euening, neither in a priuate houſe, neither leaning, neither yet with men onely. Now who would condemne the Church, if by a pure and holy conſent of the members thereof, it ſhould bee the cuſtome that euery communicant (as in the Primitiue Church the new baptiſed did) ſhould weare a white garment? <hi>Bucer. Script. Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. fol.</hi> 708. <hi>Hoopero.</hi> ſo alſo hee argueth in his Epiſtle to <hi>Io.

This argument alſo hath <hi>Zanch. de redempt. cap.</hi> 16. <hi>fol.</hi> 445. <hi>a.</hi> There is a great queſtion (ſaith hee) in theſe our dayes about Miniſteriall garments: ſurely we read not that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did appoint any thing of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; neither that they changed their garments, either when they baptiſed, or when they adminiſterd the Lords Supper, but neither did they forbid, that men might not take other
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18363:97"/> garments. Wherefore it is <hi>(liberum perſe)</hi> a matter free in it ſelfe to vſe or not to vſe other garments in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, if true Chriſtians, hauing the pure doctrine of Chriſt &amp; diſcipline in their Churches, ſhould enioine ſome ſpeciall garment though abuſed by the Papiſts, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the Miniſtery to the ſimple people, there is no Scripture forbidding a man to leaue ſuch Chriſtians to their iudgement: But there are ſundry Scriptures clearely teaching a man why he ſhould leaue them to this their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, as Rom. 14. 1. Cor. 8. and 9. and many other places, namely, whereſoeuer we are taught of the libertie and good vſe of the creatures, not of meates onely, but of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures elſe.

                  <p>Becauſe theſe Ceremonies are ancient, and haue ſome good vſe, it was an old cuſtome in the Church, that ſuch as adminiſtred the Sacraments, ſhould weare a white linen gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Zanch. ibid. ex Hieron. cont.

                  <p>Becauſe if we proceed to diſſwade from theſe indifferent things, as from pernicious and euill things, we ſhall thereby condemne very many Churches, not diſagreeing from the Goſpel; and ſhall taxe too bitterly innumerable Churches, which haue euer, and are of old celebrated, as moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and approued, <hi>P.

For mine owne part I doubt not, but the Apoſtolicall doctrine to bee moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perfect without all exception, to the which it is not lawfull to adde, or to detract any thing, howbeit, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ceremonies my iudgement is otherwiſe. For firſt, it is certaine that euen the Apoſtles themſelues, could not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately ſet downe, what they iudged to bee expedient for the Churches in their firſt beginning: and therefore neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily they proceeded by little and little, as the inſtitution of Deacons doeth make euident, in as much as they ſuffered, for a ſeaſon many Iewiſh Ceremonies, as appeareth in the

Wherefore whatſoeuer was performed by the Apoſtles in rites and Ceremonies, I doe not iudge that preſently, neither yet without ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to bee followed as a rule. And indeede I wonder not that thoſe ancient Fathers, hauing reſpect vnto their owne times, did take away ſome things, ſome things adde, and ſome what alter.

For all Churches doe obſerue in the Supper of the Lord, ſuch a time, place, and habit, or ſite of body; and beſides doe admit women to the Communion, of all which things they haue not onely no commandement, but they haue alſo his contrary example: for our Lord did celebrate his Supper at night, not in the morning in a priuate houſe, not in a publike, leaning on his ſide, (and after the receiuing of the Paſchall lambe) not ſtanding; alſo hee admitted not the women, ſundry of whom hee had for his moſt holy diſciples, <hi>Bucer.

As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Chriſt performed his Supper at night. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were wont to performe it alſo in the morning, and the Church followed afterwards this time: Should a man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon ſay, that any thing is derogated from the Supper of the Lord? ſurely no; becauſe Chriſt commanded not the ſame to be celebrated in the night, as himſelfe obſerued it, but onely <hi>(hoc facite)</hi> that we ſhould doe that (for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſubſtance) which he did, but not at that time wherin he did it. Alſo to that the Primitiue Church (as appeareth in <hi>Iustinus Martyr)</hi> did mingle Water with the Wine in the Lords Supper; it is not a ſufficient ground to ſay they alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or changed the inſtitution of the Lords Supper, and that for two reaſons; One, becauſe it may be that the Wine which Chriſt Ieſus gaue to his Diſciples was mingled with water, ſeeing the Apoſtles doe not report the contrary and it is probable, that the Primitiue Church might receiue this from the Apoſtles: Another reaſon is, becauſe the Primitiue church did not adde water as a matter altogether neceſſary,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18363:102"/> and ſo as appertaining to the ſubſtance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but only to ſignifie a myſtery; but if any did commend it as neceſſary, they did vndoubtedly depraue the Lords Supper. But they much more, who vſed onely water in the Lords Supper, as the <hi>Aquarij</hi> did, againſt whom <hi>Cyprian</hi> did write: for it is euident, that Chriſt our Sauiour vſed wine, and commaunded that wee alſo ſhould do the like. To this adde, in that the ancient Biſhops in the celebration of the Lords Supper, did put on another garment, then that they vſually did weare, appertaineth nothing to the alteration of the Lords Supper: For Chriſt commanded not that wee ſhould celebrate his Supper with our vſuall garments, as hee did, but onely that wee ſhould doe that which he did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The like may bee affirmed of ſundry other things, as well in Baptiſme, as in the Supper of the Lord. The ſumme of all is this: Such things as are added, but yet as matters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, for order, for decency, and to edification; ſuch matters do not change the ſubſtance of the Sacraments, and therefore alter not the worſhip. But ſuch things as are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the inſtitution of Chriſt, or els are added as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and appertaining to the ſubſtance, thoſe things do cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the inſtitution of the Lord, and ſo doe eſtabliſh another kind of worſhip.

                  <p n="3">3. Touching the Ceremonies of the Primitiue Fathers, they were alſo holden operatiue, not by the ſounder Fathers themſelues (as <hi>Zepperus, Perkins,</hi> and others doe alleadge for them) but by others, which did ſo accidentally, as the ſigne of the Croſſe was not holden operatiue by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxall Fathers of it ſelfe <hi>opere operato,</hi> but they held their faith operatiue, which was exerciſed in them when they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed that ſigne.

The Lutherans vſe ſome of them, and we all account of them as of true Churches: And it is not poſſible for the true Church to put operation in them, or opinion of neceſſitie, or Gods worſhip or merit in the deed doing, for that this tendeth to ouerthrow the foundation,

And who knoweth not that by the 36. Canon no man may
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18363:119"/> be either receiued into the miniſtry or ſuffered to preachor catechiſe, except he ſhal firſt willingly <hi>&amp; ex animo,</hi> ſubſcribe to the 3. articles there mentioned, &amp; to all things conteined in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yea, admit that a man were contented both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme &amp; ſubſcribe alſo, yet if he ſhall but at any time affirme (as it is euident many conformers &amp; ſubſcribers alſo wil not ſtick ſometime to do:) That the Booke of common Prayer containeth ſomething in it that is repugnant to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or that ſome of the 39. Articles are in any part ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and erronious, or ſuch as he may not with a good conſcience ſubſcribe vnto, he is to be excommunicated, <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo facto</hi> (which muſt needes imply ſuſpenſion from his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry) and not to be reſtored till he haue publikely reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſuch his wicked errour. So that though all Maſter <hi>Sprints</hi> arguments ſhal proue good &amp; vnanſwerable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he goeth about to iuſtifie the vſe of the Ceremonies in this caſe: yet will he neuer be able to conuince a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them, that haue either beene kept out, or put out of the miniſtry, of ſo foule a ſinne as hee would make the world beleeue they ſtand guilty of, vnleſſe he can alſo iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the ſubſcription, which he ſeemeth altogether vnwilling to doe, and can proue it vnlawfull for a godly miniſter to ſay, that there is ſomething in the Booke of common Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er repugnant to the Scriptures, or that ſome of the 39. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are in ſome part ſuperſtitious and erronious, and ſuch as he may not with a good conſcience ſubſcribe vnto. And if thoſe concluſions which he ſetteth downe in the firſt page of his Treatiſe, and which he ſaith will follow vpon the proofe of this point, That to ſuffer depriuation or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion for refuſing to conforme, is a ſinne; be the very marke he aymed at in his whole Treatiſe, and the only fruit he expecteth of all theſe paines he hath taken (as indeede they ſeeme to be:) then hath hee ſurely beſtowed his time very ill, and ſpent a great deale of labour to no purpoſe at all. From hence it will follow (ſaith he) firſt, That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Miniſters haue ſinned that haue ſuffered depriua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18363:119"/> ſo refuſing to conforme, they ought of conſcience to offer conformity that they may returne to their miniſtry. 2. That ſuch as not conforming doe remaine in their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are bound in conſcience to conforme, rather then to ſuffer depriuation. 3. That ſuch as are profitably or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably fitted to the Miniſtry, and deſire that calling, are tied in conſcience before God to promiſe and practiſe confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, rather then for refuſing it, to bee kept out of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. And where be thoſe Miniſters to be found in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that haue ſuffered depriuation for no other cauſe, but for that they haue refuſed to conforme? or that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued; might haue had aſſurance to inioy againe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the vſe of their Miniſtry, if they would offer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity? Or what Prelate hath he knowen, being to admit any into the Miniſtry, hath beene wont to require of him a promiſe of Conformity, and to allow him thereupon, though he did refuſe to ſubſcribe? It is not to bee doubted indeede, but that the onely cauſe that hath been pretended for the depriuation and ſuſpenſion of ſome, hath bene their refuſing to conforme, and that liberty hath bene offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, vpon this condition onely, if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme; But that this hath beene the onely cauſe, why any haue ſuffred Depriuation or Suſpenſion, will hardly bee prooued by Maſter <hi>Spr.</hi> or any other man. If then he knew it not before, let him now vnderſtand, That the true cauſe why ſo many able and faithful Miniſters haue ſuffred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be depriu'd and ſuſpended, rather then they would conforme to the Ceremonies preſcribed, hath been partly (but not only,) this; that they haue iudged the ceremonies vnlawfull, and partly, that they knew though they ſhould haue yeelded to the vſe of them, they could by no meanes haue bin aſſured, that the bearing of this heauy yoke would haue kept them in their Miniſtry, vnleſſe they could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent alſo to ſubſcribe to the Booke of common prayer, and thoſe 39. Articles according to the Canon, or at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſpeake either publickly or priuately againſt any
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18363:120"/> thing contained in them. This being ſo, M. <hi>Spr.</hi> ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt haue made it plaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the only, or at leaſt chiefe cauſe why the Miniſters haue been depriued vſually, or ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in England, hath been their refuſing to conforme; or elſe hee ſhould haue made this the ſtate of his queſtion, Whether the ſuffring Depriuation, rather then a man will conforme to the ceremonies in this caſe, when beſides con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity vpon the ſame penalty ſubſcribing to the Booke of Common prayer, and the 39. Articles, or at leaſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to ſpeake againſt any thing contained in them, is required, be a ſinne.</p>
            <p>And this ſhall ſuffice to bee premiſed for a generall an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to his whole treatiſe. Now the arguments whereby he laboureth to proue the lawfulneſſe and neceſſitie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in the caſe of Depriuation, are to be examined par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly.</p>
            <p>His firſt maine argument is this, The doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of ſuffring depriuation (ſpecially vpon the reaſons vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt our ceremonies) is contrary to the doctrine and practiſe of the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>The antecedent of this Argument (for the conſequent is ſtrong and good) hee laboureth to prooue, firſt in this manner.</p>
            <p>To refuſe to do that, which the Apoſtles with the whole Church at Ieruſalem did by Diuine inſpiration and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement doe themſelues, and both aduiſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund others to doe, is a ſinne.</p>
            <p>But to refuſe conformity in the caſe of depriuation, is to refuſe to doe that which the Apoſtles and whole Church at Ieruſalem did themſelues, and both aduiſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded others to doe: for they practiſed themſelues, and commanded others, euen whole Churches to practiſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as inconuenient and euill, for number, nature, vſe, and euill effects, as ours are ſuppoſed to be, and that for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons equiualent or inferiour to the auoyding of Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
            <pb n="215" facs="tcp:18363:120"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> to refuſe to conforme in the caſe of depriuation, is a ſinne.</p>
            <p>The propoſition of this argument, he neuer goeth about to proue, which yet is moſt falſe and vnſound: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and whole Church a Ieruſalem might by diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and ſome ſpeciall commandement of God, both themſelues vſe and inioyne others to vſe ſome Ceremonies, in themſelues as euill and inconuenient as ours, &amp; yet it may be vnlawfull for a Miniſter now to vſe ours, except he did it by the ſame in ſpiration, and had the like commandement from God, as they had. <hi>Abraham</hi> to manifeſt his faith was commanded by diuine viſion to kil his ſonne and if he had done it, hee had in ſo doing done an excellent worke; will this make it lawfull for all other belieuers for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their faith, to doe the like, when they haue not the like ſpeciall commandement from God to doe it? The contrary would bee much better concluded by this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Apoſtles doctrine and practiſe, doeth not ſo warrant a Miniſter now to conforme to ſuch like Ceremonies, becauſe they that command them to doe ſo, doe it not by diuine inſpiration, or commandement, as the Apoſtles did.</p>
            <p>That which he alleadgeth afterward for the confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this propoſition in his anſwere to the firſt obiect. <hi>pag.</hi> makes it neuer a whit the ſtronger. For firſt, the anſwere he giues, doeth but beginne the queſtion, and is the very ſame with the propoſition it ſelfe, whereof it ſhould haue beene a proofe. If the Apoſtles authoritie (ſaith he) were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate from God, and that they did was done by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, wee may bee the boulder to imitate them. Secondly, his ſecond anſwere, that though we may not imitate the Apoſtles in things peculiar to the office, perſons, and times; yet wee may in matter of common e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie, and generall reaſon: Inſteed of confirming he doth directly ouerthrow his owne propoſition, for hee grants here that it is no ſufficient warrant for vs to doe any thing,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18363:121"/> for that the Apoſtles did ſo, becauſe they did many things by diuine direction, that were peculiar to their office, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and time. Thirdly, he doeth expreſſely in this his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond anſwere affirme, that the Apoſtles did vrge the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of theſe Ceremonies, not from the immediate authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of God, nor from the inſpiration onely of the Holy Ghoſt, but by reaſons and rules of common equitie and perpetuall: Wherein beſides that, he forgets what he had vrged before in the proofe of his aſſumption, and expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradicts the text, which affirmes that all the things they did write, euen concerning matters of order in the Church, were the commandements of the Lord, 1. Cor. 14. 37. and that when they decreed theſe things in queſtion, they ſayd it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and vs, Act. 15. 28. hee hath alſo weakned his owne propoſition here, and made it of no ſtrength at all. For if the Apoſtles had vſed, or inioyned theſe things, and not done it by diuine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and immediate authority from God, whatforce could there bee in their example or commandement to bind our conſcience? The Apoſtles we know were men, and ſubiect to error (as other men) in all caſes wherein they were not immediately directed by the ſpirit of God. And if the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we are to conforme, be not this; becauſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did ſo, or becauſe they did ſo by immediate directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God: but becauſe they did that, which the rules of common and perpetuall equitie, and generall reaſon did require: then an argument drawne from the doctrine of the Scribes and Phariſes, as well as of the holy Apoſtles, might haue ſerued the turne. For we are bound to follow them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, where they do, or teach that which the rules of common and perpetuall equitie, and generall reaſon doe require.</p>
            <p>But let the reaſons be examined, whereby he is moued to iudge, that the Apoſtles did vſe and inioyne theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, not by immediate authority from God, nor from inſpiration onely of the Holy Ghoſt, but by reaſons and rules of common and perpetuall equitie.</p>
            <pb n="217" facs="tcp:18363:121"/>
            <p> They vſed &amp; enioyned theſe things (ſaith he) for expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and neceſſitie to win the more to Chriſt, and to further &amp; propagate the Goſpel; which though it be granted to be true, yet ſhall we be as farre to ſeeke as we were before; for ſtill the queſtion will be, whether there be the ſame reaſons now to moue vs to the vſe of our Ceremonies, as mooued the Apoſtles then to vſe thoſe. There might be ſuch ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all cauſes as made it expedient and neceſſary for them to vſe and inioyne ſuch Ceremonies then, as neuer did fall out before, nor ſhall doe againe while the world doth ſtand. It is indeed a rule of common and perpetual equity, that things expedient and neceſſary, that may make for the winning of more to Chriſt, and furtherance of the Goſpel, be done; but that may be expedient and neceſſary vnto theſe ends for ſome perſons at ſometimes, which yet would be neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary nor expedient for other perſons at another time to doe, without a ſpeciall and immediat calling from God. It was expedient and neceſſary, that the Apoſtles ſhould preach the Goſpel to all nations, and do ſundry other things that were peculiar and proper vnto their function, which yet none in theſe dayes may take vpon them to doe, becauſe they haue not the like immediat calling and authority from God; neither is there any thing more euident to euery rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and vnderſtanding man, then this, that the ſame things, which in ſome places and times haue been both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient and neceſſary to be done, haue at other times, and in other places proued farre otehrwiſe.</p>
            <p>That which he alleadgeth in the ſame place <hi>(viz.</hi> in his anſwere to the firſt obiection) to confirme this, that the reaſons for which the holy Ghoſt moued the Apoſtles to do thoſe things, do warrant and binde vs to vſe our cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies now, becauſe the holy Ghoſt being euer the ſame, teacheth and ruleth the Church by one and the ſame reaſon reuealed in his Word, as well now as then; is not eaſie to be vnderſtood: For if this be his meaning, (as by his words it ſeemes to be) that vpon what reaſon the holy Ghoſt at
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:18363:122"/> any time teacheth any perſon in the Church to doe a thing he teacheth all perſons in the Church to do the ſame, when they ſhall haue the ſame reaſon, becauſe hee is alwayes one and the ſame; it would follow, that whatſoeuer God hath by any ſpeciall commandement, for any ſpeciall reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, of any ſhould be done of all, where there is the ſame reaſon, though there be not the ſame ſpeciall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. And ſo, foraſmuch as God (vpon this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that <hi>Abraham</hi> might make knowen his faith) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to ſacrifice his ſonne, all men ſhall bee bound to ſhew the like readineſſe that he did, to kill his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, ſeeing the reaſon that mooued God to require this of him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concerneth them as well as him, all men being bound to manifeſt and make knowen their faith.</p>
            <p>Where he addeth, that by the ſame rules whereby the holy Ghoſt teacheth the Church to pray, and ſing in a knowen language, &amp; Prophets to ſpeake one after another, and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to be ſilent in the Church, hee teacheth that Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie which is in queſtion; becauſe they bee all caſes of one nature; namely, of order and Ceremonie in the Church, and worſhip of God; hee affirmeth that which ſeemeth to haue no colour of good reaſon in it: For theſe things are of themſelues, and by the very light of nature at all times, and in all places, matters of order and decencie, and ſuch as if no precept had been giuen, common and generall reaſon would ſay are fitting: And the contrary (in themſelues, and not in reſpect of circumſtance onely) vnſeemely; which hee will neuer (ſurely) ſay of any of theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. And what conſequence there is in this reaſon the holy Ghoſt doth no leſſe teach the one then the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are all caſes of one nature, namely, of order and Ceremonie in the Church? Are there not ſome impious and idolatrous orders, or (at leaſt) Ceremonies, ſuch as a man ought to die rather then to yeelde vnto them? Are there not, or may there not be ſome contrary to all theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules? Doth not the damnableſt idolatry, that is, lie
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:18363:122"/> in orders and Ceremonies? how can it follow then that they are of the ſame nature, and required by the ſame rules, becauſe they are matters of order and Ceremonie?</p>
            <p>And ſo much ſhall ſuffice for anſwere to the propoſition of his firſt maine argument, and to that which in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to the firſt obiection hee hath brought for the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of it: now let vs come to conſider how he proues the aſſumption of this argument. All that hee hath ſaid to this purpoſe (though it bee by him ſpread into thirteene ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall branches) may well bee referred vnto theſe foure heads, and yet nothing omitted that is worthy conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or carrieth any weight in it at all, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and whole Churches in their times, vſed as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ceremonies as ours doth. 2. That theſe many Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which they vſed, were euery way as inconuenient and euill as ours are ſuppoſed. 3. That the Apoſtles by diuine inſpiration and commaundement from God, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Churches to vſe ſo many Ceremonies of ſuch ſort. 4. That the Apoſtles were moued to doe thus, vpon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of no greater weight then the auoiding of depriuation and ſuſpenſion with vs. Theſe foure points, if he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede make good, as hee hath vndertaken to doe, then will no man deny but that hee hath confirmed his aſſumption ſufficiently.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe points concerning the number, though it be not ſet downe by him in ſo many words, yet it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently collected from that which hee hath heere written, without any wreſting of his words or peruerting of his meaning. For when he ſaith, The holy Apoſtles, with the whole Church at Ieruſalem did practiſe themſelues, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned whole Churches the practiſe of ceremonies in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber equall vnto ours, there is no doubt to bee made but that he intended to ſay as much, as in this firſt point he is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſay. Let vs therefore obſerue well how he proueth this. The Ceremonies (ſaith hee) that they (that is the Apoſtles and Church at Ieruſalem, and whole Churches of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:18363:123"/> diuers and farre diſtant Countries and Nations, namely the Gentiles in <hi>Antiochia, Syria, Cilicia)</hi> did vſe, were diuers: as namely circumciſion, ſhauing the head, vowing, purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, contributing, offering ſacrifices for the perſons puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, obſeruation of the Iewiſh Sabboths, abſtaining from bloud, abſtaining from ſtrangled. Whereunto this anſwere may be giuen; firſt, that ſundry of theſe 9. things which he hath here reckoned vp, can with no good reaſon be called Ceremonies. In the laſt clauſe of his anſwere to the firſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, when he had matched praying and ſinging in a knowne tongue, the Prophets ſpeaking one after another, and womens keeping ſilence in the Church, with our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, he makes this the reaſon of it: Becauſe (ſaith he) they be all caſes of one nature, namely of Order and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in the Church and worſhip of God. Whereby hee ſeemeth to vnderſtand that this is of a nature of a Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to bee vſed in the Church and in the worſhip of God: which if it bee ſo, then ſurely can neither abſtaining from blood, nor abſtaining from ſtrangled be accounted Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. And though it be granted that all theſe nine things he mentioneth, were once commanded in the Ceremoniall Law, yet that the Apoſtles or Churches he ſpeaketh of, did vſe any of them as Ceremonies, or as in obedience to that Law, he wil neuer be able to proue. If a man in theſe daies ſhould abſtaine from fleſh in Lent in the preſence of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt whom he is loth to offend, and of whom he conceiueth hope, that by condiſcending to him in this hee may winne him to the Goſpell: or if a Miniſter coming to a people Popiſhly affected; ſhould he (hauing the gift of continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) for the ſame reaſon for beare to marry? would any man ſay, that either the one of theſe, or the other did in ſo abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning practiſe any Ceremony? or was it a Ceremony in <hi>Paul,</hi> when hauing preached long among the Corinthians and Theſſalonians, hee departed from his right, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare to take any maintenance from them?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If hee will needes haue all theſe 9. points to be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:18363:123"/> yet can hee not make their Ceremonies any whit neere equall in number vnto ours: For it will be eaſie (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially accounting ceremonies as he doth heere) for their 9. to reckon vp 49. that are vſed among vs. 3. Theſe 9. ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of his, can neuer be proued to haue beene vſed or practiſed by the holy Apoſtles, the whole Church at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and thoſe whole Churches of diuers and farre countreys and Nations he ſpeaketh of, namely of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in Antiochia, Siria, and Cilicia. For the vſe of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, he brings the example of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who is mentioned once to haue vſed it; But for Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Contributing, offring Sacrifices for the perſons puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he proues that not <hi>Paul</hi> only, but foure men more did once ſo, Act. 21. 23, 24. 26. for vowing and ſhauing of the head, that <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo, not only at that time with thoſe foure men, Act. 21. 24. but once before, Act. 18. 18. For the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Iewiſh Sabbaths; That in one place <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> preached on the Iewes Sabbath in a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, Act. 13. 14. In two other places, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Iewes in their Synagogue vpon their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day, Act. 17. 2. &amp; 18. 4. for as for the place Act. 13. 42. hee hath much miſtaken it: For the Gentiles deſired them to preach to them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. on ſome day between that and the Sabbath. And laſtly, for abſtaining from blood, and ſtrangled, he alleadgeth the decree of the Councill at Ieruſalem, ſent vnto certaine Churches of the Gentiles, Act. 15. 29. Thus wee ſee, that whereas he did vndertake to proue, that the holy Apoſtles, the whole Church at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and ſundry other whole Churches of ſundry Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Apoſtles times did vſe and practiſe more Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies then the Church of England doth, he hath not been able to ſhew that either the Church of Ieruſalem, or any one Church then, did practiſe any one Ceremony, or any Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle either beſides <hi>Paul:</hi> or that <hi>Paul</hi> did at any time vſe more then 6. Ceremonies at the moſt: or that he vſed any of thoſe ſixe aboue once or twice at the vttermoſt. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:18363:124"/> abſtaining from blood or ſtrangled, was enioyned as any Ceremony to the Churches of the Gentiles, nor the preaching or diſputing in the Synagogues vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, <note place="margin">Mat. 20. 55. Act 13. 42. and 20. 3. Act. 17. 17. and 19. 9.</note> can with any better reaſon be called a religious obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Iewes Sabbath, then Chriſts or <hi>Pauls</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and diſputing dayly when occaſion was offred, will argue, that they did religiouſly keepe and obſerue as holy, euery day in the weake. And this may ſuffice to haue been ſaid of the firſt point, wherein hee equalleth the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies vſed in the Apoſtles time, with ours now; namely, the number of them.</p>
            <p>The ſecond point, wherein the confirmation of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption conſiſteth, is this; That thoſe ceremonies which the Apoſtles and the Churches in their times vſed, were euery way as inconuenient and euill as ours are.</p>
            <p>And that hee may make this good, he takes vpon him to ſhew, 1. That they were as euill in nature, as ours are. 2. That they had beene, and were as much abuſed as ours are, or haue beene. 3. That the vſe of them wrought as dangerous effects, as the vſe of ours can doe. 4. That whatſoeuer is obiected againſt our ceremonies, might haue beene ſaid againſt them.</p>
            <p>To all which this anſwere may be giuen, that no one of all thoſe teſtimonies of holy Scripture, which he here citeth to ſhew what names and titles the holy Ghoſt giueth to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, that were vſed in thoſe dayes; how Ceremonies were then abuſed; what euill effects the vſe of them did bring foorth, doth make any whit at all to his purpoſe, nor can with any colour of reaſon, be applied vnto any ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which either the Apoſtles themſelues, or any Church by their appointment did vſe. For 1. they were no yokes or burdens, or burdening Traditions, as the places which himſelfe (a ſtrange thing) citeth, doe euidently ſhew: for by Act. 15. 10, 28. it is manifeſt, that the Apoſtles would by no meanes be drawne to inioyne Ceremonies as were ſuch yokes and burdens. Neither could they truely bee called
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18363:124"/> ordinances of the world, commandements or doctrines of men, or voluntary religion. For beſides that, neither the Apoſtles, nor the Churches that vſed them by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, did put any religion in them when they vſed them: if they had done it, yet had not this beene voluntary religion, or a ſubiecting themſelues to the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or doctrines of men. Becauſe as theſe things at the firſt, were of diuine inſtitution, ſo during the time that the Apoſtles did inioyne the vſe of them, they remained ſtill the commandements of the Lord, as it is euident by that wee finde written, Act. 15. 28. 1. Cor. 14. 37. no more could they be termed impotent and beggarly rudiments, ſo long and ſo farre forth, as the Apoſtles did vſe or inioyne them, but were of great force and ſufficiencie, and ſerued vnto very good vſe, for the winning of the Iewes vnto, or retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them in the loue of the Goſpel. This is made the reaſon, both why <hi>Iames</hi> councelleth <hi>Paul,</hi> to doe as he did, Acts 21. 20. 24. and why <hi>Paul</hi> became a Iew, to the Iew, 1. Cor. 9. 20.</p>
            <p>If it be admitted, that all theſe places were meant of the Iewiſh Ceremonies (as indeed the moſt of them were) and euen of thoſe which the Apoſtles and Churches did yeeld to the vſe of; yet will Maiſter <hi>Spr.</hi> bee neuer able to proue (and if he proue not this hee ſaith nothing to the purpoſe) that when and where the Apoſtles of thoſe Churches vſed them, they had beene notoriouſly knowen to haue beene ſo abuſed, or to haue wrought ſuch euill effects, as hee here ſpeaketh of. Nay it is euident, that after they grew into ſuch abuſe, and ſuch euill effects followed the vfe of them, the Apoſtles were ſo farre from vſing or inioyning them, as they did vtterly refuſe the vſe of them themſelues, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it to the Churches, therefore <hi>Paul</hi> who once had vſed circumciſion, and ſome other of the Ceremonies himſelfe doeth afterward, with great ſharpeneſſe, and bitterneſſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue, and condemne the vſe of them, Gal. 4. 9. 10. and 5. 12. Tit. 1. 14. which places and ſuch like, it is very ſtrange
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18363:125"/> that Maiſter <hi>Spr.</hi> would alleadge to proue that the Apoſtles, and Churches in their time by their appointment, did vſe Ceremonies as bad as ours. For can any man be ſo abſurd, as to imagine that the Apoſtle would euer practiſe, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe things after that they were growne ſo bad, after that hee had ſeene iuſt cauſe to inueigh againſt them, and condemne them in that manner? To this purpoſe alſo the Apoſtles reſolution, in not ſuffering <hi>Titus</hi> to be circumciſed (when hee ſaw what an abuſe that Ceremonie was growen vnto, and how dangerous an effect was like to follow it, if hee had yeelded vnto it) maketh very ſtrongly, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any thing that hee would ſeeme to ſay to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in his anſwere to the ſixt obiction, as ſhall further appeare in the diſcuſſing of the fourth point, that hath bene obſerued in the confirmation of this his aſſumption.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it were granted, that the Ceremonies which the Apoſtles vſed and appointed, had bin notoriouſly knowen to haue beene ſubiect to ſo great abuſe of ſome, and to haue had in them ſo euill effects, euen before or at that time, and in thoſe places alſo, where the Apoſtles inioyned them: yet could not this haue proued them euery way as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, and euill as ours are. For ours are ſaid (and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proued alſo, as they ſuppoſe who haue ſuffered depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or ſuſpenſion for this cauſe) to bee euill, not onely becauſe they haue beene groſſely abuſed, and very euill effects haue followed the vſe of them (for ſo much may be ſaid alſo of ſome of Gods owne ordinances) but for that they neuer were good, nor can euer ſerue to any good vſe. Thoſe, as they were at the firſt the ordinances of God, ſo they are here ſaid by Maiſter <hi>Spr.</hi> to haue beene ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned to certaine Churches by the Apoſtles; which if it be ſo, then could no abuſe, that obſtinate Iewes, or other wicked men had put them vnto, make the vſe of them either vnlawfull, or inconuenient vnto the faithfull, that by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolicall (that is diuine) authoritie, were required to vſe them.</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:18363:125"/>
            <p> And here fitly commeth to bee examined, whether that bee true which is affirmed by him in his ſecond reaſon, which he brings for the proofe of this point, <hi>viz.</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in ſubſtance is obiected againſt our Ceremonies, which might not haue been ſaid aſwell againſt thoſe which the Apoſtles and Churches of their times did vſe. In hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this point, as he hath left out much of the force and ſubſtance of euery argument, which in the Abridgement (the booke which himſelfe quoteth) are ſet downe againſt our Ceremonies, ſo hath hee affirmed much more againſt them which the Apoſtles then vſed, then he is able to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie and make good. The trueth is, that though euery one of thoſe foure arguments doth ſtrike to the heart the ceremonies of our Church; yet is there neuer a one of them that doth giue the leaſt touch vnto thoſe which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Churches then did vſe.</p>
            <p>For firſt, Ours are humane inuentions, notoriouſly knowen to haue been of olde, and ſtill to bee abuſed to ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and ſuperſtition by the Papiſts, and yet of no neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vſe in the Church: Theirs, as they were at firſt by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſtitution, ſo were they not at that time when they vſed them, notoriouſly knowen to haue been abuſed, either to idolatrie, or to the confirmation of falſe and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious doctrine, and were at that time of neceſſary vſe: and though they had been neuer ſo much abuſed, and had beene alſo in any other of no neceſſary vſe; yet becauſe they were vſed, by warrant of Apoſtolicall and diuine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, this firſt argument toucheth them not at all, hee doth indeede denie all this, and quoteth Scripture to proue that they were humane inuentions, of no neceſſary vſe, and abuſed to ſuperſtition. But it hath beene already ſhewed, that all theſe Scriptures are miſunderſtood, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by him; &amp; no more ſhal need to be ſaid for the conuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of him in this point, when that himſelfe (cleerely and ſtrongly contradicting himſelfe) hath both elſewhere in this argument, and euen in this very place affirmed. For
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18363:126"/> were they humane inuentions, which himſelfe here ſayth were practiſed and taught by direction of the holy Ghoſt? were they of no neceſſary vſe, which he in the proofe of his firſt propoſition of his firſt argument, Num. 8. affirmes to haue bin commanded by the Apoſtles, as matters good and neceſſary in that caſe, and brings for proofe thereof? Act. 15. 28.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Ours are humane Ceremonies appropriated to Gods ſeruice, and ordained to teach ſpirituall duties, by their myſticall ſignification. Theirs, as they were not appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Gods ſeruice, ſo neither were they vſed or appointed by the Apoſtles to bee vſed for myſticall ſignification; or if they had, yet (ſeeing as hath before beene ſhewed) they were not humane Ceremonies, this argument doth not concerne them. It is true indeed that they were in their firſt inſtitution ſignificatiue and myſticall, and thus much the places quoted by him here, <hi>viz. Col.</hi> 2. 16. 17 <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. &amp; 9. 8 23 &amp; 10. 1. do proue: But that either the Apoſtles vſed them or ordained them, that they might teach ſome ſpirituall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by their myſticall ſignification, that hee hath not ſo much as indeauoured to proue. And ſurely if <hi>Paul</hi> did vſe circumciſion as a Sacrament, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 3. then by the force of Maſter <hi>Spr.</hi> argument heere (which maintaineth it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to doe now what the Apoſtles or Churches in their time did:) it may be concluded that it is lawfull for vs to vſe in Gods ſeruice, other Sacraments then thoſe which God hath ordained.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Ours being but humane Ceremonies are eſteemed, impoſed, and obſerued as parts of Gods worſhip. Theirs cannot be proued to be obſerued by them, much leſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed vpon them as parts of Gods worſhip; and if they had, yet becauſe they were not humane Ceremonies, this argument maketh nothing againſt them: For what is this to the purpoſe that heere hee takes vpon him to prooue, That the Iewes eſteemed, impoſed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued them as neceſſarie to ſaluation, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. 5?
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18363:126"/> That the zealous Iewes were violently offended with <hi>Paul,</hi> for teaching that Chriſtians ought not to circumciſe their children, and to liue after the legall cuſtomes <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 27? That the Apoſtles ordained them as good and neceſſary, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 28. 29? That the Apoſtle conformed himſelfe vnto them for their ſakes, and in their preſence that eſteemed them as worſhips of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 1. 5. &amp; 16. 3. &amp; 21. 26? Seeing the queſtion betweene vs is not heere, whether the Iewes obſerued and impoſed Ceremonies, as bad as ours; but whether the Apoſtles or any Church by their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did ſo. Did the Apoſtles or any of them, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Ceremonies is now in queſtion betweene vs, vſe any Ceremony as impoſed by thoſe Iewes he ſpeaketh of here? And what though the Apoſtles called thoſe things that by their decree was inioyned good and neceſſary? will it follow from thence that they impoſed them as parts of Gods worſhip? or can nothing be good and neceſſary, but that which is a part of Gods worſhip? Though the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious eſtimation the people among who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are vſed, haue of them be obiected by the miniſters in the abridgement (&amp; that iuſtly and materially) againſt our ceremonies: Yet doth not the maine forces of this third argument lye in that, but in this rather; that though they be but humane Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, yet they that inioyne them doe eſteeme and impoſe them as partes of the worſhippe of God, which puts a manifeſt difference betweene them and the Ceremonies that were vſed by the Apoſtles, or any Church by their appointment.</p>
            <p n="4">4 In the impoſing and vſing of ours, thoſe rules that are preſcribed in the Word for matters of direction in the Church concerning Ceremonies, are not kept. For they are no way needfull or profitable for the edification of the Church, but are knowne to cauſe offence euery where, and hinderance vnto edification<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are obſerued only for the will and pleaſure of them that doe inioyne them. Theirs though they were vſed and appointed by them, who had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18363:127"/> more farre abſolute authority, and might lawfully haue commanded in the Church of God, ſpecially doing that they did by the inſpiration of the holy Ghoſt: yet were they alſo ſquared &amp; directed by the rules of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and were no way offenſiue, but tended greatly to the edification of Gods people. And how often hath Maſter <hi>Spr.</hi> affirmed in the proſecuting of this argument, that they were profitable and neceſſary, and alleadged for proofe thereof, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 28. 29. though heere as forgetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hee doe deny it? Yea this very Section heere, wherein hee takes vpon him to prooue they were not needfull or profitable, they ſerued rather to deſtroy then to edifie the Church, he concludes with this clauſe; Yet their vſe and yeelding ſerued to edifie, by making way to the Churches peace and furtherrnce of the Goſpel. And this vaine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting himſelfe he taketh ſuch pleaſure in, as he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth it to the end of his diſcourſe, wherein he laboreth to proue that the fourth argument againſt the Ceremonies in the abridgement, maketh as ſtrongly againſt the Apoſtles, as againſt our Church. They were not profitable for order (ſaith he, in the beginning of that Section) and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of it affirmes, yet it was order to vſe and practiſe them in that caſe. And in the beginning of the next Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, hauing ſaid, they were not profitable for decency; for what was more vndecent then for a Chriſtian to vſe idle, vnfruitfull, needleſſe and beggarly rudiments; by and by he addes, yet did this indecency vphold an higher decency: Which laſt phraſe of ſpeech (beſides the contradiction) is very hard to be vnderſtood; for how can indecency ſupport decency? or in what ſenſe can the eſtabliſhment of the faith, and the dayly increaſe of the number of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches bee termed a higher decency? or how could the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency of theſe Ceremonies eſtabliſh the faith and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Churches. After this in going about to ſhew that they were offenſiue many wayes, in the fift Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee ſaith, that in the euent they did ſerue indeede as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18363:127"/> meanes to infringe the Chriſtian liberty, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after; yet the vſe and practiſe of theſe things by the direction of the Apoſtles did procure the liberty of the Goſpell: So that if M. <hi>Spr.</hi> himſelfe be to be beelieu'd, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry indifferent and vnderſtanding man will eaſily diſcerne that the 4. Argument which the Miniſters haue vſed againſt our ceremonies in the abridgement, doth not any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne thoſe which the Apoſtles did vſe. And ſurely it would be altogether needleſſe to inſiſt longer vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this part of this his Diſcourſe, but that there is one thing affirmed by him, which may not be paſſed ouer: For noting this to be the 4. way, whereby thoſe ceremonies were offenſiue; that the Apoſtles themſelues were offended in impoſing that they did, hee addeth that they taught againſt the things which they inioyned; that namely, they ought not to be vſed by the Iewes or Gentiles. It is ſtrange any learned or Godly man ſhould ſo farre forget himſelfe, as to charge the holy Apoſtles to haue inoyned the faithfull to vſe thoſe things which themſelues did teach ought not to be vſed, either by Iewes or Gentiles; ſpecially when the text expreſly ſaith, that what they inioyned, they inioyned by the direction of the Holy Ghoſt. The place he citeth to proue this that he ſaith, <hi>viz.</hi> Act. 21. 21. doth not affirme that <hi>Paul</hi> had taught ſo indeed, but that the Iewes had been ſo informed of him: and by <hi>Iames</hi> his words verſ. 24. it appeares alſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was falſe. And if this which he ſpeaketh of the Apoſtles preaching this againſt that which they did ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, were to be belieued, (which God forbid) what had hee gained by it? ſurely that there could be no force in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample or decree to bind vs in conſcience to vſe thoſe things which they in their doctrine did teach ought not to be vſed by any Chriſtian: And ſo this his firſt Argument, wherein he hath laboured ſo much and with ſo great confidence, is by himſelfe vtterly ouerthrowen.</p>
            <p>The third maine point in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of the aſſumption of his firſt Argument is this, That the Apoſtles by diuine
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18363:128"/> inſpiration and commandement from God, required the Churches to vſe ſo many Ceremonies, and ſuch as were as inconuenient and euill as ours are ſuppoſed to bee. That whatſoeuer the Apoſtles did inioyne the Churches, they did it by diuine inſpiration &amp; commandement from God, is ſo vndoubted a truth, as he needed not at all to haue trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelfe in the confirmation of it, it being ſo hard to find any ſcholler that would ſo much gainſay, or call this in queſtion, as hee himſelfe hath (ſometimes) done in this Treatiſe. All the queſtion in this point is, Whether euer the Apoſtles did inioyne vnto whole Churches ſo many Ceremonies as ours are, and thoſe alſo as inconuenient and euill as ours are: This he goeth about to prooue after this manner; They cauſed others to practiſe ceremonies: for <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothie,</hi> Act. 16. 3. and tooke the men, and was purified with them, Act. 21. 26. They aduiſed one another to practiſe ceremonies: for <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders perſwaded <hi>Paul</hi> thus to conforme, Acts. 21. 23. 24. They inioyned or commanded the practiſe of Ceremonies: for thus did the Councill at Ieruſalem, Act. 15. 28. 29. This conſtitution is called the decrees that were ordained by the Apoſtles and Elders, Act. 16. 4. and the determination of the Apoſtles, Act. 21. 25. and this commaundement they gaue to whole Churches of diuers and farre diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys and Nations, namely to the Gentiles in Antiochia, Siria, and Cilicia, Act. 15. 23. and afterwards he addes that the Ceremonies that they did thus cauſe others to practiſe, aduiſe one another to practiſe, inioyne whole Churches to practiſe, were as inconuenient and euill as ours, both for number, nature, and euill effects.</p>
            <p>For anſwere vnto all this: Firſt, it were ſufficient to ſay, That he hath not performed that, which he hath vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, becauſe hee prooues not that the Apoſtles inioyned ſo many Ceremonies as wee haue in our Church; or that any one of thoſe Ceremonies which hee ſaith they did inioyne, were as inconuenient and euill as ours are: And for this
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18363:128"/> point hee is to be referred to that which hath beene anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto the two former partes of his Aſſumption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though he had proued, that they did inioyne vnto ſome one, or ſome few perſons ſuch Ceremonies, as were both for number and for nature as bad as ours: yet vnleſſe hee had ſhewed, that they had inioyned them vnto whole Churches, hee hath not concluded that which he tooke in hand. And therefore that which hee brings of <hi>Pauls</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Iames</hi> perſwading <hi>Paul</hi> to purifie himſelfe, is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hee hath not proued (nor euer will bee able to doe) that the Apoſtles did ioyne the practiſe of any one of thoſe Ceremonies to any one Church, or to any one perſon, eitheir by inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. For as for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion of <hi>Timothy</hi> though it be true that <hi>Paul</hi> did it, &amp; did it well: yet it would be a harſh ſpeach and vniuſtifie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to ſay, that he compelled, or inioyned, or commanded <hi>Timothy</hi> to be circumciſed. And for that which <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders ſaid to <hi>Paul</hi> concerning his purifying, beſides that it cannot haſtily bee called a commandement, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction (becauſe no Church or Apoſtle had ſo much au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ouer <hi>Paul,</hi> as to command him any thing, 2. Cor. 11. 5. Gal. 2. 6. 9.) Maiſter <hi>Spr.</hi> knoweth well, that ſome are <note n="‖" place="margin">

               </note> great Diuines, who haue plainely affirmed that <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders, did ill in preſſing <hi>Paul</hi> ſo farre in this matter; <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Caluin. in act.</hi> 21. 22. 23.</note> others ſtand in doubt whether they did well in it or no; ſure it is, hee can neuer ſoundly proue, either out of this or any other place of Scripture, that they did it by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, or commandement of God. The place which hee puts moſt confidence in for the proofe of this third point is Acts 15. for there we read indeed of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree ſent by the Apoſtles vnto ſundry Churches, and that decree was made by the inſpiration, or direction of the Holy Ghoſt. But to this place it may bee anſwered that things mentioned in this decree, were ſo farre from being ſo many Ceremonies, or ſo bad as ours are (which hee muſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18363:129"/> ſtill bee put in minde, that hee ſhould haue proued) that in very deed they were no Ceremonies at all, neither euer came into the minde or purpoſe of the Apoſtles, when they made that decree to inioyne the vſe of any Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to the Churches. For to omit this that the meere ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining and forbearing the vſe of many things, can with no good ſhew of reaſon bee called the vſe, or practiſe of a Ceremonie; though the abſtinence from bloud &amp; ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, were once a ceremoniall dutie (while the law was in force) yet it was now inioyned by the Apoſtles to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, not as a ceremoniall, but as a morall dutie, that they ſhould abſteine from their libertiy in the vſe of theſe indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things, when they ſaw the vſe of them would offend their weake brother. And ſurely ſeeing the reaſon and end of this abſtinence was not any ſuch miſticall ſignification, as it had vnder the law, but onely to auoide the offence of the Iew; it could no more bee called a Iewiſh Ceremony, then if either out of a naturall loathing of thoſe meates, or reſpect had to their health, or ſome ſuch like conſideration, they had forborne the ſame. Neither let M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Spr.</hi> thinke it ſtrange that the ſame thing, which being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded in the law, was a Ceremonie, ſhould now, being commanded by the Apoſtles, alter the nature and become no Ceremonie. Let him conſult with the beſt Diuines, and Interpreters of the Scripture, and he ſhall finde, that though circumciſion, was a Sacrament vnder the Law, yet <hi>Timothy</hi> his circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caluin. in Act.</hi> 16. 3.</note> was no Sacrament; and that all the Ceremonies of the law were ſo abrogated by the death of Chriſt, as that (though ſome vſe of them did remaine for a time) yet they did no longer belong to the worſhip of God, nor were figures of ſpirituall things, nor were obſerued in conſcience of obedience to the ceremoniall law: In which things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the very life and eſſence of a Iewiſh Ceremonie, and without which nothing can in good propriety of ſpeach bee called a Ceremonie. But what neede any more bee ſaid of this matter, when the Apoſtles themſelues ſpeaking of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18363:129"/> this decree affirme that they that ſaid the Gentiles ought to keepe the law, did in ſaying ſo, ſeeke to ſubuert their ſoules: that they had written and concluded, that the beleeuing Gentiles ſhould obſerue no ſuch thing, (as vowing, ſhauing of the head, purifying, &amp;c.) ſaue only that they keepe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from ſtrangled, and from fornication: By which wordes alſo they doe plainely intimate, that this abſtinence which they inioyne in this decree, was no ſuch thing, (but of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kinde and nature) as vowing, purifying, ſhauing of the head, offering, &amp;c. and conſequently was not inioyned by them as any Ceremony of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt point in the confirmation of his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is this, that the Apoſtles and Churches were moued thus to enioyne and practiſe ſuch Ceremonies, ſo many, ſo inconuenient and euill, vpon reaſons of no greater weight, then the auoiding of depriuation is with vs.</p>
            <p>This hee prooueth by ſpecifying the cauſes and reaſons that moued the Apoſtles to practiſe and enioyne thoſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which hee ſayth were theſe three: Firſt, for the beleeuing Iewes that they might not bee offended, nor oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned to turne backe to Iudaiſme, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 1, 3. and 21. 20, 21, 24. Secondly, for the vnbeleeuing Iewes, that they might be wonne to the Goſpel and ſaued, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 20, 22. and 10. 32, 33. Thirdly, to auoyd the perſecution of the malicious Iewes, and ſo to redeeme the libertie of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, which otherwiſe was like to be indangered, <hi>Act.</hi> 21. 22, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>For anſwere vnto all this, it may be ſaid, that if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had practiſed &amp; inioyned ſuch as are euill Ceremonies as ours are, they had farre greater reaſon ſo to doe, then the auoiding of depriuation is with vs. For firſt, as their miniſtery was of more great excellencie then ours, whether we reſpect the extraordinary gifts wherewith they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, or the wonderfull power of God, which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18363:130"/> them, and giue ſucceſſe and fruit to their labours: ſo the redeeming of the liberty of their miniſtery (if that were any cauſe, as he here ſuppoſeth it was) was, and ought to haue been of much more weight to moue them to doe as they did, then the continuance of vs in our miniſtery can be to perſwade vs to the vſe of our Ceremonies. What one Miniſter of the Goſpel is there that dare to bee ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, as to ſay that his preaching and miniſtery can bee of that neceſſity and vſe for the glory of God, and good of his Church, as was the miniſtery of any Apoſtle? The worke whereunto the Lord hath called and ſeparated the Apoſtles, <hi>(viz.</hi> the planting of the Church, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel to all nations) was ſuch as could not haue beene performed by any other but the Apoſtles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone: But in the depriuation of our Miniſters that refuſe conformitie, there is no ſuch danger, and of their prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, there can bee no ſuch neceſſitie imagined; though they preach not, the Goſpel is preached ſtil, and that ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fruitfully. And how then can Maſter <hi>Spr.</hi> ſay, that the auoiding of depriuation with vs, is a reaſon either ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior or aequiualent vnto that which mooued the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to doe as they did? if hee had ſaid, there is great ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and analogie betweene theſe two caſes, he had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken probably, but to maintaine a paritie betweene them he hath no colour of reaſon at all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Apoſtles in vſing and inioyning thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, might bee well aſſured that they ſhould greatly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſucceſſe of the Goſpel thereby, the beleeuing Iewes would bee preſerued from Apoſtaſie, the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (many of them) would be gained and that they ſhould not onely obtaine libertie, and freedome for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie by this meanes among the Iewes, but that the very vſing of theſe things would edifie them. Now our Miniſters haue no reaſon that is either Superior or aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent vnto this, to perſwade them to the vſe of our Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, for they cannot be aſſured that the vſing of our
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18363:130"/> Ceremonies would doe any good at all: no they are well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by many reaſons &amp; long experience that they would doe much hurt euery way, both vnto the belieuer, and to him that is not yet called to the faith. And ſhould not he (thinke you) haue great cauſe to brag of this bargaine, who after that he had purchaſed the liberty of his miniſtry by yeelding vnto conformity, ſhould finde euer after a wofull experience, that he hath done much more hurt by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, then good by his miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Apoſtles in vſing &amp; inioyning thoſe Ceremonies (if they had enioyned any) and the Churches alſo in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them by their appointment (if any ſuch thing had bin were well aſſured in their conſciences they did that which was not onely lawfull but neceſſary for them to doe, and that they had ſinned if they had not done ſo: for they had diuine authority to warrant &amp; command to do as they did. Will Maſter <hi>Spr.</hi> ſay that the auoiding of depriuation with vs, is a reaſon either ſuperiour or equiuolent vnto this? our Miniſters can diſcerne no ſuch warrant for the vſe of our ceremonies, but are fully aſſured they haue this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment expreſly to the contrary: And will any man perſwade them that for the auoiding of depriuation, or a far greater penalty (though indeede that be very great) they may do a thing which they are aſſured is euil in the ſight of the Lord.</p>
            <p>For a concluſion to this anſwere vnto his firſt maine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, it ſhall not be amiſſe to ſet downe and repeat ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry materiall differences betweene the caſe of the Apoſtles and Churches in their times and ours now.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They vſed ſuch Ceremonies only, as both at the firſt were diuine ordinances, and the vſe whereof was warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them by diuine authority; We are required to vſe ſuch as are inuentions, not humane onely but Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They vſed them in this perſwaſion of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they might in that caſe and ought to be vſed: neither did they euer inioyne them to any that held them
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:18363:131"/> vnlawfull: ours are impoſed vpon ſuch as are perſwaded in their conſcience they cannot vſe them without ſinne.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They vſed them but once or twice vpon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſion: we are required to vſe ours conſtantly and continually in the ordinary exerciſe of our miniſtery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They neuer vſed them, but when they ſaw euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the vſe of them would preuent ſcandall, and tend vnto edification: we are required to vſe ours, though we ſee euidently the vſe of them would hinder edification, and giue offence many waies.</p>

            <pb n="237" facs="tcp:18363:131"/>
            <p> Touching the Preface or generall anſwere, made before the Anſwere to particulars, it might, as I ſuppoſe haue been well ſpared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as being to ſmall purpoſe, and quite beſides the point in queſtion: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Anſwerers could not be ignorant and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, drift in handling, matter, manner, whole courſe of proſecuting in euery Argument, doe plainely ſtretch no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to enforce Conformity in caſe of Depriuation. Therfore this caution is but a voluntary and ſtudious wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring from the queſtion; Neither doe theſe arguments la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to make the world beleeue, that all depriued Miniſters haue ſinned in ſuffring Depriuation, but ſo many onely as for not conforming, haue ſuffred depriuation. Therefore this ſpeech of theirs is either an vntrue ſurmiſe, or a ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ironie.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though the Anſwerers ſhould bee ignorant that any Miniſter ſhould ſuffer Depriuation for onely refuſing to conforme; yet all the faithfull Miniſters of theſe our parts doe know the contrary of ſundry: my ſelfe doe know it of my ſelfe, and others. And who can be ignorant, that diuers Miniſters haue been depriued only for not conforming, by inditements at Aſſiſe and Seſſions, as well as by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and doe perpetually ſtand liable to that cenſure; and is a cauſe ouer-ruled, as appeareth in the Lo. <hi>Cookes</hi> reports? Againe, it is well knowen, that for theſe later 5. or 6. yeeres, ſubſcription hath not been vrged to Incumbents or ſetled Miniſters, but meere conformity: And Biſhops haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being put in minde by men of learning in the Lawes, that they could not vrge Subſcription, either by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Statute, or the booke of Canons, to ſuch as were already placed and ſetled in their charges. It was therefore vnaduiſedly and vntruely affirmed (to ſay no more) that M. <hi>Sprint</hi> ſurely beſtowed his time very ill, and ſpent a great deale of labour to no purpoſe at all. And the queſtion is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſolued, which asketh, Where be thoſe Miniſters to bee found in England that haue ſuffred Depriuation for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18363:132"/> cauſe, but for that they haue refuſed to conforme.</p>
            <p>But beſides the caution here made, the Brethren my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers were not ignorant of the principall point, which they ſhould haue thought vpon chiefly, and would haue qualified this their cenſure; that for mine owne neceſſary reſolution in a doubt of depriuation, I vndertooke this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe at firſt; and yet beſides they doe forget, that in my reaſons there are ſpecified other ends and vſe of this my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that it ſhould not be ill beſtowed; namely, to mooue all Miniſters who were depriued, euen for Subſcription, as well as for non-conformity, to try whether by offer of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity they might not returne vnto their Miniſtry, which would be a cauſe of wonderous benefit and comfort to the Church. Alſo it ſerueth to reſolue and quiet ſuch as are to enter, which being ſcrupulous to conforme, can receiue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance by none other meanes. And laſtly, it hath vſe for profeſſors of Religion, which without conformity to the ceremonies, (as kneeling at the Communion, or admitting the croſſe) can by no meanes in the moſt places receiue the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of Baptiſme, or the Lords Supper: which things haue bred no ſmall perplexity of minde, and outward trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to many godly perſons, who if by this meanes of my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour they might be reſolued (as they may bee, if they will follow the iudgement and practiſe of all true Churches and faithfull teachers ſince Chriſt) would proue labour to great and good purpoſe, and farre from labour very ill beſtowed. Men ſhould beware of bearing falſe witneſſe againſt their neighbour, or his honeſt labours: If therefore the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns anſwere prooue no ſounder in the particular then in the generall, out of all queſtion it is but weake, which now I will further conſider of.</p>
            <p>And before I giue reply vnto the particular anſwere, let my Brethren know, that this Argument vrged by me, is no fancy of mine owne, but hath bin thus conceiued, euen as I vrge it, by perſons of moſt reuerend note in the Church of God, ſuch as <hi>Caluin, Martyr, Zanchius, Vrſinus, Piſcator,</hi>

            <p>Now to the anſwer of my firſt reaſon.</p>
            <p>Which firſt reaſon of mine, when my Brethren went about to anſwere, if they would needes vnſtrip out of his owne coat which I had framed, and draw into a Syllogiſme of their owne, yet ought they not to make an argument, or new reaſon of their owne, and ſo to fight without an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary: But their duetie was (as they wel know) faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to haue taken all the ſubſtance of that I ſet downe in the whole reaſon, and that eſpecially included in my Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, which they haue not done: pietie and ſinceritie, and faithfull dealing ſhould goe together; and thus they ſhould haue laid it downe.</p>
            <p>To refuſe to practiſe ſuch Ceremonies, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by direction of the holy Ghoſt, and vpon reaſons
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:18363:134"/> of common and perpetuall equity did practiſe themſelues, and cauſed others to practiſe, yea aduiſed and enioyned (as matters good and neceſſary to be done) on others, eſpecially in a like caſe in ſundry maine and materiall reſpects, is a ſin.</p>
            <p>But to refuſe conformitie with our Ceremonies in the caſe of depriuation, is to refuſe to practiſe ſuch Ceremonies, which the Apoſtles by direction of the holy Ghoſt, and vpon reaſons of common and perpetuall equitie did pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe themſelues, and cauſed others to prctiſe; yea, aduiſed and inioyned (as matters good and neceſſary to bee done) on others, and that in like caſe in diuers maine and material reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo:</hi> To refuſe to conforme in the caſe of depriuation, is a ſinne.</p>
            <p>The Propoſition of this argument thus propoſed, is ſufficiently confirmed in that which is included in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member of mine anſwere to the firſt obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in theſe words [though we may not imitate the Apoſtles in things peculiar to their office, perſons and times, yet we may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lollow them, and are bound in conſcience ſo to doe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of common equitie, and generall reaſon: for as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had warrant from the holy Ghoſt, ſo haue we war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from the Apoſtles examples, and from the reaſons for which the holy Ghoſt moued them to doe theſe things.]</p>
            <p>Thus if my Brethren had propoſed mine argument, they needed not to haue ſpent ſo many words, nor ſounded ſuch a triumph before the victory: <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the propoſition is falſe and vnſound.</item>
                  <item>2. That I neuer go about to proue it: which aſſertion of theirs they ſtreight confute themſelues, by ſetting down my proofes of the propoſition.</item>
                  <item>3. That I forgot my ſelfe what I had vrged before.</item>
                  <item>4. That I weaken my propoſition, and make it of no ſtrength.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But let vs ſee what materiall ſhew of exceptions they bring againſt the propoſition of mine argument.</p>
            <pb n="243" facs="tcp:18363:134"/>
            <p> Whereas I ſaid that the Apoſtles did vſe and inioyne the Iewiſh Ceremonies, not onely by immediat authority from God, but by reaſons alſo and rules of common and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall equity, and further did giue inſtance of the rule of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency and neceſſity out of Act. 15. 28. The anſwere is, that though it be granted to be true, yet ſhall they be as farre to ſeeke as before they were: For ſtill the queſtion will be, whether there be the ſame reaſons now to moue vs to the vſe of our Ceremonies as moued the Apoſtles then, becauſe they ſuppoſe there might be ſome ſpeciall cauſes might make thoſe Ceremonies neceſſary, which neuer fell out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nor ſhall doe ſo againe. And to this I ſay that there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no ſuch further ſeeking as before: and the queſtions demanded touching common reaſons with the Apoſtles, were ſet downe in the ſelfe ſame place where they read the other, in the words immediately following, which reaſons are theſe; namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To winne the more, 1. Cor. 9. 19. 20. 21. 22. Now all men know, that this reaſon ſhould moue euery godly miniſter in his place, and according to his parts and calling to labour the winning of ſoules, no leſſe then it did moue the Apoſtles, for all are required to be faithfull, 2. Cor. 4. 1. 2. all are alike commanded of God in the Prou. &amp; all alike are to receiue reward, Dan. 12. 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To further and propagate the Goſpell, 1. Cor. 9. 23. which alſo is a common care appertaing to vs now, as to the Apoſtles then. For the commandement giuen to the the Apoſtles doth ſtretch in reſpect of place to all Nations, Matth. 28. 19. Luk. 24 47. and in regard of time, to the end of the world, Mat. 28. 19. 20. Reu. 14. 6. 7.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the following (might be or) ſuppoſall of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes might haue well beene ſpared, vnleſſe they had been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: For my Brethren doe well know that <hi>A poſſe ad eſſe non val et argumentatio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Howbeit they confeſſe at laſt that the two forenamed reaſons be matters of common and perpetuall equity (what
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18363:135"/> need then was there to ſeeke for that they had, or queſtion that they grant at laſt?) and yet againe they ouerwhelme them with a new ſupply of vnwarranted ſuppoſalls [that ſomething may be expedient for ſome perſons and times, as are not for other without a ſpeciall calling from God:] But heere againe the former rule cuts them off from arguing from a naked and vnproued ſuppoſal: And indeede it is but <hi>petitio principij,</hi> an encroaching on the point in queſtion: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it is a very feeble anſwere that is onely affirmed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proofe; ſo might a man argue againſt the practiſe of euery part of diſcipline practiſed by the Apoſtles, which may be ſaid to be proper to their function, time and place. Therefore it followeth by this kinde of argumentation: their practiſe may ſeeme to giue vs no ſtronger warrant, then the practiſe of thoſe Ceremonies in the caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, vnleſſe we were inſpired and had immediate authority from God: The like might be argued from other ſundry matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the exception of the next member or allegation, that namely, the holy Ghoſt teacheth &amp; ruleth the Church by the ſame reaſon reuealed in his Word, as well now as then: and therefore the reaſons warranting the Apoſtles to conforme to the Iewiſh ceremonies, may moue vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme to theſe in the like caſe;] It ſeemeth to me a palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cauill, and it may ſeeme probable to others, that my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would heere ſtudiouſly not vnderſtand my meaning. For what need was there for me (as they could poſſibly ſuppoſe, to proue a duty of common equity, by an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary caſe, or by a ſentence of extraordinary ſence? And if there had beene that difficulty in that ſentence which they pretend: yet Grammer might haue put them in minde that ſentences of doubtful interpretation, ſhould be conſtrued by that which immediatly goeth before, or followeth after, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if it cohaere therewith. Now the rules or reaſons ſpoken of in that very place immediatly before, as alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after this ſentence, are expreſly ſpecified to be rules
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18363:135"/> and reaſons of perpetuall and common equity, which they could not be ignorant of, and therefore the inſtance of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> vrged this ſecond time commeth in heere as vnſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably as it did before, that is as much to ſay, as to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Laſtly, to the inſtance which I gaue out of 1. Cor. 14. 27, 30, 31, 34, 35, 40. It is anſwered by my Brethren, that I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which ſeemeth to haue no colour of good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it; namely, becauſe of the different natures of the Iewiſh ceremonies, and of theſe preſcribed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the forenamed place. Howbeit. I ſay againe, although there be diſagreement in reſpect of diſsimilitude of Ceremonies, the one ſort of them decent of themſelues, and by the light of nature, the other ſort (namely, for a Chriſtian to practiſe Iewiſh Ceremonies) vnſeemely; the one ſort fitted to all times, the other only practiſed in certain caſes, and in ſome Churches; yet there is agreement betweene them in thoſe things for which they are alleadged: For 1. both ſorts are matters ceremoniall and circumſtantiall, not ſubſtantiall or fundamentall. <hi>Ceremonia</hi> may bee <hi>genus</hi> to them both. 2. Both ſorts were preſcribed and practiſed by the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. 3. Both ſorts had the ſame rules, grounds, or ends of practiſe: namely, Neceſſity, expediency, profit and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church. Now touching our Ceremonies, albeit they be not of that nature altogether with thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed of the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 14. yet I ſuppoſe them to be of the nature of the Iewiſh Ceremonies practiſed by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and therefore doe conclude with all godly learned tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers that euer vttered their iudgements herein, that for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, expediency, profit, and edification of the Church, as for the liberty of the Goſpel, and preuenting the depriuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of faithfull Teachers, they may lawfully, and muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be practiſed, no leſſe then the Iewiſh practiſed, or the Chriſtian Ceremonies preſcribed by the Apoſtles, 1. Cor. 14. As for the queſtion concerning impious and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous orders, ſuch as a man ought rather to die, then yeeld
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:18363:136"/> vnto their practiſe, I maruell my Brethren would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that if they ſpeake of other Ceremonies then ours, they are beſides our queſtion, and touch not the point in hand. If of ours, yet that they doe ſtill <hi>petere principium,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they plainely prooue our Ceremonies as they are vſed in our Church, to bee ſuch indeede. And thus much alſo ſhall ſuffice for the defence of the propoſition of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>Now to the anſwere of the Aſſumption.</p>
            <p>The anſwere, which my Brethren make, they haue redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to 4. heads, replying to 4. parts of mine Aſſumption. Touching 1. the number, 2. the nature, 3. the warrant or ground, 4. the reaſons of practiſe of the Iewiſh ceremonies and ours.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> In the firſt part of mine Aſſumption, whereas I affirmed that the ceremonies which the Apoſtles practiſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, were in number equall to our ceremonies; The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere of my Brethren hath three members.</p>
            <p>The firſt member ſaith, That ſundry of the things I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, can with no good reaſon be called Ceremonies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would enforce my words againſt their will, to ſay that I defined a ceremony to be that, which is vſed onely in Gods worſhip: But ſundry of the things alleadged were not ſuch, and therefore by mine owne account they were not Ceremonies. But my Brethren ſhould know, that howſoeuer I ſay, that there bee Ceremonies in Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, yet that letteth not, but that there may be ceremonies out of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds worſhip; and ſo that collection of theirs is marred: But if for once I ſhall let it ſtand, and bee as they would haue it, what could they get by it? As though eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ceremony of the ceremoniall Law, whereof wee ſpake, were not a worſhip of God, becauſe whatſoeuer God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth, is a worſhip to performe: Therefore theſe things were both worſhips, and Ceremonies in Gods worſhips ſometimes, which if my Brethren had remembred, they would haue blotted out this for a cypher; yea, by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:18363:136"/> abſtaining from blood, and ſtrangled, muſt needes bee Ceremonies, though they would not haue it ſo: Which might further appeare, becauſe it is one diſtinction of the Ceremonies of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, that they were either of action, as circumciſion, or of abſtinence, as abſtaining from ſwines fleſh, blood, and ſtrangled: Becauſe they had ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were ſhadowes of good things to come, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Ceremonies. Laſtly, becauſe ceremoniall duties, and therefore Ceremonies, ſeeing they were included vnder, and commanded by the ceremoniall law of God, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing denomination from that law: Which laſt reaſon my brethren themſelues doe giue hereof; therefore by their confeſſion they are Ceremonies. But they adde that I ſhall neuer be able to proue, that the Apoſtles or Churches did vſe them as Ceremonies, or as in obedience to that law: And I ſay againe, ſuppoſe I neuer goe about to proue it, what needeth me to doe it? What if I grant (as I doe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that it is true and euident, and that it can by no meanes bee proued, nay that the contrary is manifeſt? It ſuffiſeth me that they inoyned theſe things, that were ſome times duties, though not as they were duties of the law, meerely ceremoniall, and now after Chriſt his death, when as the holy Apoſtles practiſed them, were fruitleſſe, dead, vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in themſelues: yea which might &amp; did proue hurtfull vnto ſome, which held them ſtill as worſhips, Col. 2. 23. and meanes of iuſtification, Gal. 5. 2. 4. and euen neceſſary to ſaluation, Act. 15. 1. 5. Wherefore the inſtances of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from fleſh, or from mariage, for the wining of a Papiſt, and of <hi>Pauls</hi> departing from his right, are of no valew.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond and third members, concerning the number and often vſe of the Ceremonies alleadged, I anſwere, that albeit they grant but ſixe of the Iewiſh Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and alleadge nine and fortie Ceremonies of our Church: yet the Ceremonies which are queſtioned by the depriued Miniſters at this time, ſuch &amp; ſo many I meane, as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18363:137"/> come vnder the compaſſe of their practiſe, or of this our queſtion, that is ſo many, the practiſe whereof would keepe a man from depriuation, are not ſixe, as Croſſe in Baptiſme, Surpleſſe, Ring in Mariage, obſeruation of Holy-dayes, &amp; if there be one or two more, let it be ſo. It is a matter needles to contend about the number, and about the often vſe and iniunction of them. For if I proue but one Iewiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, at one onely time vſed lawfully by the Apoſtles, yet as euill in the moſt maine and materiall reſpects, as ours are, and that by reaſons of common and perpetuall equitie, thence I will argue the lawfulneſſe of the Apoſtles vſing them an hundred times, and in an hundred Churches. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine if <hi>Paul</hi> did lawfully practiſe circumciſion on <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> and ſhauing, vowing, offering, and purifying on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, I will conclude, that he might as lawfully practiſe on the like occaſions, and for the ſame iuſt reaſons, the moſt part of the Ceremonies of the law ceremoniall, if need had beene, which amount to a farre greater reckoning, then the Ceremonies of our Church make them, as many as my brethren may. In a word, if they were lawfully practiſed, then might the practiſe thereof be lawfully inioyned vn-the Churches where neceſſitie enforceth; ſeeing it is the iniunction of a lawfull and needfull thing. As for thoſe proofes of mine, which my brethren doe ſift cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my drift or practiſe; there was no neede for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo to wreſt them, and then to lay the wreſting of them to my charge, as if from them I had concluded, <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet.</hi> They were orderly and perſpicuouſly ſet downe by mee vnder euery head or member, in as much as that without wreſting and abuſing, they could not intend more then I did there cleerely proue by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For though I did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to proue euery head or member of my propoſition, by the Scripture annexed to them in ſeuerall; yet I did not vndertake to proue euery member, or any member by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Scripture, as my brethren would inforce vpon me: This dealing of my brethren was not ſo direct as I could wiſh.</p>
            <pb n="249" facs="tcp:18363:137"/>
            <p> And one thing more, that whereas I alleadge the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles iniunction of abſtaining from blood and ſtrangled; My Brethren anſwere, that theſe Ceremonies were not by them inioyned as Ceremonies to the Churches of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: That alſo of their obſeruation of preaching on the Iewiſh Sabbath, they ſay it cannot bee called a religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. As if they could produce or conclude out of my wordes, any ſuch abſurd or vnſound doctrine as my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would ſeeme to thruſt vpon me: Or as if it were not ſufficient to my purpoſe, that the Apoſtles inioyned to the Churches of the Gentiles, and obſerued the time of the Iewiſh Sabboth, matters which were Ceremonies of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> law, and in themſelues fruitleſſe, though not religiouſly, or as Ceremonies of the Lawe (as before I noted) ſuch an aſſertion would ſerue a Papiſt well, who obſerueth humane Ceremonies, as religious obſeruations, which our Church diſclaimeth, and therefore were it needleſſe for any man to ſtraine himſelfe to ſuch a purpoſe.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The ſecond point of mine aſſumption, is touching the nature of the ceremonies, where my brethren do reſpect the ſecond member of my confirmation of the aſſumption to be this: That thoſe Ceremonies, which the Apoſtles and the Churches in their times vſed, were euery way as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, and euill as ours are in their iudgement: And to make this good, my Brethren tel the Reader that I take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me to ſhew.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That they are as euill in nature as ours are.</item>
               <item>2. That they had been, and were aſmuch abuſed as ours haue been.</item>
               <item>3. That the vſe of them wrought as dangerous effects as the vſe of our can doe.</item>
               <item>4. That whatſoeuer is obiected againſt our Ceremonies might haue been ſaid againſt them.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To which report of theirs, I ſay, before I proceede fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to anſwere, that, ſeeing trueth needs no falſhood or fraud for confirmation (for God needes not the helpe of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18363:138"/> mans lye) I doe greatly maruell, that my Brethren (men of that approued pietie, learning and ſharpe iudgement, ſhould be found failing in their fidelitie, as I doe herein challenge them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the vntrue reporting of my aſſertion, as is euident by collation of either part.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They report that I ſhould ſay, that thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which the Apoſtles vſed, were euery way as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient and euil as ours, and that it may appeare it was no ſlip nor ouerſight, they proceed to miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete, that I ſhould ſay that they are, firſt, as euill in nature, as our ceremonies are; ſecondly, as much abuſed; thirdly, and hauing as dangerous effects in the vſe as ours haue.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas it is true, that I ſay, that they were as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient and euil as ours; but I ſay withall in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry maine reſpects, which is farre from that which my Brethren do report, namely, euery way as euill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The like dealing my Brethren vſe in miſreporting me touching the fourth member of the things alleadged: Firſt, I ſay, the ſame obiections in ſubſtance, and for the moſt part which are obiected againſt our Ceremonies, to proue them ſimply euill, might be obiected againſt the Ceremonies practiſed by the Apoſtles. But they wil haue me ſay, that whatſoeuer is obiected againſt our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, might haue beene ſaid againſt them. But thus an el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother might eaſily put beſides his yonger Brother from that benefit of enioying his poore patrimonie: The Fathers will ſaith the elder Brother ſhall haue his Fathers goods for the moſt part; but the elder Brother ſaith, that his Father gaue him all whatſoeuer; what equitie were this, let my Brethren iudge.</p>
            <p>Secondly another exception againſt my Brethrens lacke of fidelitie towards mee is this, that they alleadge the heads of probation, but they conceale the moſt part of the proofs of thoſe heads, by which they be confirmed. And further
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18363:138"/> in taking ſuch things, which they thinke they may ſay moſt againſt, with greateſt probability, and leauing much more that ſtrongly maketh againſt them as by collation the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may iudge eaſily: But by this dealing who may not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily confute the cleereſt trueth, or confirme the ſtrongeſt error?</p>
            <p>Now to the reply of my Brethren to this ſecond point, touching the nature of the Ceremonies, which is by them diſtinguiſhed into three members.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they ſay that no one of thoſe teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alleadged by me touching the titles giuen to Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, how abuſed, what euill effects they had, doth make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whit to my purpoſe, or can with any colour of reaſon be applied to any Ceremony vſed or inioyned by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and they bring out three or foure inſtances to which they ſpeake, leauing cleane out and paſſing by all the other Scriptures cited by mee and annexed to the euill vſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thoſe Ceremonies, which are very many: which places and proofes doe ſtill remaine in full force, and had beene anſwered, as I ſuppoſe, if there were not that force in them which is vnanſwerable. Wherefore my Brethren ſhould not haue thus ſaid, that no one of the teſtimonies make any whit to my purpoſe, vnleſſe they had anſwered all; for wherefore ſhould they ſay [not one] and leaue ſo many vntouched? To anſwere three, and ſuffer more then thrice three or foure to eſcape their cenſure? But let vs ſee the places which they deale withall. Firſt, they ſay the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies vſed or inioyned by the Apoſtles were no yokes or burdens or burdening traditions] This is vntrue: For circumciſion vrged, Act. 15. 1. is called a yoke. verſ. 10. and a burden, verſ. 26. Yet after that <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> Act. 16. 3. Whereupon I inferre that the holy Apoſtle did practiſe ſome legall Ceremon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (though in his owne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not as a legall Ceremony, or in obedience to the Law ceremonial, or as a yoke and burden, but in other materiall reſpects) in ſometime and on ſome perſon after that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18363:139"/> to him, and was euident that the ſame Ceremony among other perſons, and at other times was a yoke and a burden. And is it not ſtrange that my Brethren ſhould not ſee this, but impute it to me as a ſtrange thing? But they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned none ſuch Ceremonies as were yokes and burdens: admit of that, the queſtion is of practiſe of Ceremonies to auoide depriuation, not of inioyning. Next they affirme that they could not bee called ordinances of the world, commandements or doctrines of men, or voluntary reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; neither could they be termed impotent and beggarly rudiments:] I ſay againe, yes they might be ſo termed and that lawfully. For the holy Ghoſt in the Apoſtle doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly terme them ſo in the ſame words; both the obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dayes, moneths, times and yeres Gal. 4. 9. 10. Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies, new Moones, Sabboth daies, Coloſ. 2. 16. 22. as alſo abſtinence from meates. Touch not, taſte not, handle not, Col. 2. 10. 21. 22. 23. which was the very thing enioyned by the Apoſtles, Act. 15. 28. If the Holy Ghoſt called them ſo, we may be bold to terme them ſuch. But my Brethren ſay that they could not be termed ſuch ſo long and ſo far forth as the Apoſtles did vſe or inioyne them. The which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere by diſtinguiſhing betweene there nature and the vſe that the Apoſtles had of them. In their nature they were ſuch as they were called yokes, burdens, or burdening tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, impotent and beggarly rudiments; not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the vnbeleeuing or ignorant beleeuing Iewes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe; but vnto the godly and beſt inſtructed Chriſtians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for which of them would willingly haue vſed them without occaſions of neceſſity to auoide a further incoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience? yea conſidering them alſo in themſelues: for ſeeing Chriſt himſelfe was come, the body of what ſound vſe or erudition could they be, what could they teach but Chriſt to come, which was already come, which alſo was an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth? or what comfort could they miniſter to the Gentiles to whom they were inioyned; or to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> by whom they were practiſed, but as yokes and burdens? only
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18363:139"/> the comfort of their practiſe was the good purpoſe which they ſerued for, the winning of the Iewes, or retaining of them in the loue of the Goſpell, as the reaſons alleadged by my Brethren out of Acts 21. 20. 24. 1. Cor. 9. 20. doe ſhew, which were the cauſes of the Apoſtles vſe of them, &amp; made their practiſe lawfull. But this much is ſufficient to prooue the point in queſtion: For this ſheweth the nature of thoſe ceremonies to agree with the nature of ours. As the Iewiſh ceremonies, ſo likewiſe ours barely conſidered in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, which the Papiſts &amp; many profeſſed Proteſtants abuſe, may be accounted in a ſort yokes burdens, burdening traditions, commandements and doctrines of men, voluntary religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, impotent and beggerly rudiments, &amp;c. yet as the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies practiſed by the Apoſtles; ſo alſo ours by the ſame analogy in a caſe of neceſsity of expediency, to redeeme the liberty of the Goſpel in the Miniſtry of many good Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, they are good and neceſſary, and the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God to practiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond member of this Section affirmeth, That it will neuer be prooued by me, (and if not, then nothing is ſaid to the purpoſe) that when and where the Apoſtles, or thoſe Churches vſed them, they had beene notoriouſly knowen to haue beene ſo abuſed, or to haue wrought ſuch euill effects as I there ſpeake of.] And my anſwere is, That it is true, theſe ceremonies were not at all abuſed by any well grounded Chriſtians at any time or place. But it is not poſſible but my Brethren ſhould know, that the ceremonies well vſed by the Apoſtles, Churches, and other godly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were knowen by them to haue been groſſely abuſed (euen as I alleadged in my firſt reaſon) by the refractary and weake Chriſtian Iewes euery where, euen then when as they practiſed them (like as we know that our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies haue been, and are abuſed by Papiſts and weake Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) notwithſtanding which abuſe &amp; knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they perſiſted to vſe them as often as neceſſity enforced, and iuſt occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was offred. For <hi>Paul</hi> knew how the Iewes
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18363:140"/> abuſed circumciſion, to eſtabliſh an opinion of the neceſſity thereof vnto ſaluation, Act. 15. 1. yet after this knowledge he vſed it, Act. 16. 3. and when S. <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> for the Iewes ſake, is it not euident that the Iewes had a falſe and abuſiue opinion and practiſe of circumciſion (to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent whoſe vniuſt offence, <hi>Paul</hi> did it) notwithſtanding which, the Apoſtle practiſed Circumciſion on <hi>Timothy.</hi> Likewiſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> his reprouing of <hi>Peter</hi> for abuſe of Iewiſh ceremonies, in cauſing of Gentiles to conforme vnto them, Gal. 2. 11, 12, 14. whether wee referre the time thereof to <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Paraeus in Gal.</hi> 2. 104.</note> Act. 11. 26. or as <hi>Paraeus</hi> doth to Act. 15. 30. 35. was before his circumciſing of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and his vowing and ſhauing of himſelfe, Act. 18. &amp; 21.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, was it not knowen to the Apoſtles, when they obſerued the occaſion of the Iewiſh Sabbath to preach vnto them, that the Iewes had an opinion of neceſſity of obſeruation of that day? as they had, Ioh. 9. 16. Luc. 13. 14. Matt. 12. 2. Or could Paul and the Apoſtles bee ignorant, that vowing, offring, contributing, ſhauing, (dueties of the ceremoniall Law) were abuſed by the Iewes both before they practiſed them, and where they practiſed them, and euen by occaſion of their practiſe, which doeth eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the violence which the Iewes vſed on a bare ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a profeſſed enemie vnto the Legall rites, Act. 21. 21, 27, 29. As for that which my Brethren alledge concerning <hi>Paul,</hi> who hauing vſed circumciſion and other Ceremonies, doth after with great bitterneſſe reprooue and condemne the vſe of them, Gal. 4. 9 10. and 5. 12.

Whereupon I conclude that <hi>Paul,</hi> euen after the reproofes of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to Galat. 2. and 4. and Tit. 1. would haue beene no leſſe ready to haue circumciſed <hi>Titus,</hi> in a like caſe with <hi>Timothy,</hi> then hee was to circumciſe <hi>Timothy</hi> after the decree of the councell of Ieruſalem, as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Perkins</hi> noteth on Galathians 2. and ſo I ſay touching our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, though in our Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the miniſtry and libertie of the Goſpell, a man were bound to conforme to the preſcribed Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: yet if wee were called to a caſe of confeſſion, if the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were vrged as needfull to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if our conſcience were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to vſe them, if iuſtification were taught in their vſe, I holde plainely, that a man ſhould loſe goods, liberty, life &amp; miniſtry, then to conforme vnto them: wherefore there is no ſuch abſurdity, as my Brethren preſuppoſe, in affirming that which is with ſo good eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence approued, and that which I
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18363:141"/> alleadged in my anſwere to the ſixt obiection (though my brethren promiſed to anſwere it but did not) ſtandeth firme.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third member (fearing leaſt it might be proued, which in the former member is denied) putteth caſe, that if ſuch abuſe, or euill effects of ſuch Ceremonies vſed by the Apoſtles, had beene knowne before, or when they vſed them: yet would not this proue them euery way, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient and euill as ours] where my brethren forget that they goe on in peruerting my words. For I ſaid not, that I would proue them euery way ſimply as inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as our Ceremonies, but added expreſſely in ſundry maine reſpects. Let it be ſuppoſed that thoſe Ceremonies, were ſometimes Gods ordinances, &amp; inioyned to Churches by the Apoſtles, &amp; that theſe our Ceremonies were neuer good, nor in themſelues may ſerue to any good vſe, what ſerueth this to ouerthrow my concluſion, which is this, that the Iewiſh Cermonies were as inconuenient, and euill as our Ceremonies? then in conforming to the like caſe we ſhall doe well: and if wee doe euill in conforming to the Ceremonies to preuent depriuation, then did the Apoſtles and other perſons euill in a much like caſe to conforme to Ceremonies, as euill and inconuenient as ours are deemed in many maine reſpects. And here my brethren thinke fit to examine the contents of my ſecond reaſon, which is brought for the proofe of this point: Which is this as they affirme for mee [that nothing in ſubſtance is obiected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our Ceremonies, which might not haue beene ſaid as well againſt thoſe, which the Apoſtles and the Churches in their times did vſe.] Here againe I call vpon my brethren for fidelitie, for I propoſed my ſecond reaſon thus [That the ſame obiections in ſubſtance, and for the moſt part which are brought forth againſt our Ceremonies, to proue them ſimply and in nature ſinne, may be obiected and applied to the doctrine, and practiſe of the Apoſtles.] The differences are theſe: firſt, I propoſe the reaſon affirmatiuely, they
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18363:141"/> negatiuely: Wherewith they giue themſelues more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to confute, and mee leſſe to defend, as all men knowe. Secondly, they ſay, that nothing in ſubſtance is obiected, leauing out that which I added [and for the moſt part:] Thirdly, they adde, which might not haue been ſaid, [as well] which words I haue not, but they haue added for their owne aduantage: Which alteration if my Brethren had not made, they needed not accuſe me, that I left out much of the force and ſubſtance of their arguments; For I well know, that in ſome things, agreement in both caſes would not ſtand, and yet my reaſon would haue iuſtified it ſelfe. But I muſt goe along to ſee how well my Brethren proue the point they affirme, namely, that the arguments made by them doe ouerthrow our Ceremonies, and yet neuer a one doe giue the leaſt touch to thoſe which the Apoſtles and the Churches vſed; and to this purpoſe they runne ouer foure members, or orders of differences betweene the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of our Church, and thoſe practiſed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſort of difference affirmeth that our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are, firſt, humane inuentions; ſecondly, notoriouſly knowen to be abuſed to ſuperſtition &amp; falſe doctrine; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and of no neceſſary vſe in the Church, all which ſuppoſe I grant, let my Brethren tell me plainely, whether theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions might not haue beene vrged by the Paſtors of the Gentiles, touching the iniunction made at Ieruſalem, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence from blood and ſtrangled, and touching the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of Circumciſion, ſhauing, vowing, offering, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Iewiſh Sabboth by <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles: That namely, theſe Ceremonies are ſimply vnlawfull, and in nature euill. Firſt, becauſe Ieſus Chriſt heing come, which was the body, of whoſe comming they were ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, and therefore in their nature rudiments of great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and weakeneſſe (impotent and beggerly rudiments) and in themſelues conſidered, of no vſe or profit; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leauing to be Gods commandements, (for God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18363:142"/> them as ceremonies, in the time of the Law, not in the time of the Goſpel) in as much as being preſſed by the blinde and wilfull Iewes, they were called the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of men, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. I would know here of my Brethren, what maine difference there is betweene the inuentions of men, and the commandements of men.</p>
            <p>Seconly, becauſe they were abuſed to ſuperſtition, and falſe doctrine many wayes, and had very many euill and pernicious effects, as I haue proued in the firſt reaſon of my firſt argument, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11. 12. which cannot be denied with any ſhew of contradiction.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe they were notoriouſly knowen to haue bin ſo abuſed, euen wherſoeuer the Chriſtian faith was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Italy, Graecia, Aſiaminor, Syria, Coeloſyria, Iudaea, Creta;</hi> and may wee thinke, that the famous controuerſie and Councel at Ieruſalem for deciding thereof, about the falſe opinion about Circumciſion was not notoriouſly knowen vnto all the Chriſtian Churches, which alſo preſcribed ſome Iewiſh Ceremonies, on occaſion of abuſe of other, as alſo the tumult made on <hi>Paul</hi> by the furious Iewes at Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem: In a word, whereſoeuer the Iewes were (as they were ſcattered almoſt in euery part) and new Iewiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts, there muſt needes be knowen their notorious abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the legall Ceremonies; and I much admire that my Brethren ſhould denie this.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Becauſe they are of no profitable vſe, becauſe of no vſe at all, (I meane in themſelues, and in their nature being conſidered) being as ſhadowes without a body, weak rudiments without ſignification, ſhewes without ſubſtance, types and ſimilitudes without an antitype, yea, reſemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of nothing: Though I denie not but they were of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and very profitable vſe in the Apoſtles practiſe; but that was not in reſpect of any power in themſelues, or of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vertue which the Apoſtles gaue them by their iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as meanes and weapons of neceſſitie to defend the Church from miſchiefe, and the Goſpel from interruption,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18363:142"/> which by no meanes they would haue practiſed without ſuch neceſſitie; the like I ſay of our Ceremonies. Theſe things being ſo cleere and euident, it muſt needs follow that theſe Ceremonies, in their nature, muſt bee tainted with that formal and inſeparable euil, which the arguments of the depriued Miniſters doe faſten on our Ceremonies, ſo farre forth as they agree in theſe Circumſtances alleadged: which my Brethren fearing, are faine to runne into their old and onely refuge; That though they had been neuer ſo much abuſed, and had been alſo in any other reſpect of no neceſſary vſe, yet this aagument toucheth them not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were vſed by warrant of Apoſtolicall and diuine authoritie: But that I may driue my Brethren from this their <hi>vltimum refugium,</hi> I ſay their anſwere is of no force at all, which appeareth by theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the anſwere of our Brethren is barely affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, without all ſhew of proofe or reaſon, which is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted with a bare deniall and matter of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Eâdem facilitate comtemnitur qua probatur,</hi> as the olde ſaying of <hi>Hierome</hi> is: yea the Holy Ghoſt is ſilent and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not the leſt touch, to intimate that this action was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the Apoſtles, and how can my Brethren ſpeake ſo confidently where the Holy Ghoſt is ſilent.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the equall neceſſity of the Church in all ages, and like care which God hath of his Church in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing equall remedy, who doth not onely command and inioyne duties for the purity and comely order of the Church, but alſo prouideth remedies againſt the diſeaſes thereof. Now is there not a neceſſity for other things (aſwel as for theſe Primitiue Churches) to appeaſe diſſentions, ſchiſmes, tumults, interruption of the Goſpell, depriuation of Miniſters, ariſing from inconuenient and abuſed Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies? Muſt all other Churches beſides theſe for euery inconuenient Ceremony, or other thing of like nature with the Iewiſh Ceremonies, ſuffer the Church to bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, and the Goſpell interrupted? did God giue them
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18363:143"/> onely priuiledge thus to conforme, and not to others in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes, or did he giue remedy to their euills, and take it from vs? If it ſeemed good &amp; neceſſary to the Holy Ghoſt in one cauſe for the good of the Church, to giue way to the practiſe of inconuenient Ceremonies of this nature; by what reaſon ſhould it not bee ſtill as good and neceſſary for other Churches in the like caſe, in the ſight of the ſame bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpirit to practiſe the like Ceremonies?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> rehearſing his practiſe of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Iewiſh Ceremonies, doth draw his practiſe thereof out of a generall doctrine, 1. Corinthians 9. 19. The generall doctrine is this; That though hee were free from all men (as euery faithfull Miniſter is) yet he made himſelfe the ſeruant of all men (as in this ſenſe euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter ſhould doe) to winne the more. From this ground he deduceth his particular practiſe, verſ. 20. of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming a Iew vnto the Iewes, that is, of practiſing the Iewiſh Ceremonies for the Iewes ſake to auoide their ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, and to winne them to the Goſpel; ſhewing and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that out of this generall doctrine any godly and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Miniſter of the Goſpel, might lawfully and ought needfully to conforme to the like Ceremonies of the Iewes in the like caſe, to win them and to gaine liberty to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Therefore I conclude the Apoſtles practiſe of Iewiſh Ceremonies was not peculier to them, as ariſing from meer Apoſtolical authority, and that the practiſe of like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenient ceremonies in the like caſe is lawful &amp; needful.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe the ſame Apoſtle, declaring his withſtanding of the practiſe of Iewiſh Ceremonies in other caſes, doth ſpecifie the reaſons thereof, namely, 1. They would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men vnto it, Galat. 2. 2. and bondage their Chriſtian liberty, Galat. 2. 4. with Act. 15. 1. 5. 10. 19—3. And it was not the right way to the truth of the Goſpel, Galat. 2. 14. Therefore I conclude they practiſed the Iewiſh Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies by a certaine and ſtanding reaſon, and not alone by Diuine or Apoſtolicall authority. If they had not beene
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18363:143"/> Apoſtles, by theſe reaſons they would haue practiſed them in theſe caſes or the like.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe by this means any ſhifting diſputant, may ſhift off al neceſſity of the practiſe of any part of Apoſtolical diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and order, namely of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of obſtinate offenders, becauſe a matter peculiar to the Apoſtles, as <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

            <p n="6">6. Becauſe all godly learned iudgements (before my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) haue iudged as I iudge hereof; Therefore their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is againſt all godly learned iudgements; with whom if I erre, (not obſtinately as ſeeing no better reaſon) I ſhall retaine my peace. The Scriptures that I quote to prooue the Iewiſh ceremonies, practiſed by the Apoſtles, to haue been in themſelues of no neceſſary vſe, humane inuentions, and abuſed to ſuperſtition, my Brethren diſalow, and ſay that they are miſ-vnderſtood, and miſ-applied by mee, as they haue ſhewed; the trueth whereof appeareth in my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere to that ſhew of theirs. And they ſay further, that I contradict my ſelfe cleerely and ſtrongly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they conuince mee: But why? Becauſe I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of their different titles, nature, and vſe, in different re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes; namely, that in ſome reſpects I ſaid, that they were called commaundements of men, and ordinances of the world, impotent and beggerly rudiments, ſhadowes of things already come, and therefore fit to be aboliſhed, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no neceſſary vſe, but very hurtfull and offenſiue in
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18363:144"/> ſundry maine reſpects, and becauſe the Apoſtles taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their not neceſſary vſe, and yet in other reſpects were practiſed and taught by the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as matters good and neceſſary, Act. 15. 28. then both which members of affirmation, what can be more cleere? vnleſſe my Brethren will ſay (which I am aſſured they will abhorre to ſay) that the Holy Ghoſt doth contradict himſelfe in the Apoſtles, for that I herein ſay no more then I am taught to ſay by the Holy Ghoſt in the holy Scriptures, by all claſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writers. The ſecond ſort of difference which my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren make betweene our ceremonies, and the Ceremonies of the Apoſtles practiſe, ſheweth that our Ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humane ceremonies, are firſt appropriated to Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: Secondly, ordaind to teach ſpirituall dueties by their myſticall ſignifications, which theirs were not. To the firſt of which, I ſay, Firſt, That ſome of the ceremonies practiſed by the Apoſtles, albeit they were not appropriated to Gods ſeruice, that is, his immediate worſhips, yet they might ſeemes to be appropriated thereunto; ſuch as circumciſing, offring vowing. For what were theſe things, being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as God required, but the immediat ſeruices of God, or elſe as ſhewes thereof? If hee did them as ſhewes onely of Gods ſeruices, and not as ſeruices there might ſeeme to bee a taking of Gods Name in vaine: or if he did by them ſerue God when they were out of vſe, and left to be commanded of God, there might ſeeme to be ſome fault in Pauls action. Well then, how ſhall wee cleare Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of one or other errour? Verily not as my Brethren would doe, who would ſay, that hee did it by meere diuine authority, and nothing elſe; as if God ſhould for a time command theſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies a new vnto the practiſers thereof.</p>
            <p>But my anſwere is this, that if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the Apoſtles did not appropriate the practiſe of Gods ſeruice one way, that is, to his immediate woorſhip: yet did they appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the practiſe of them vnto the ſeruice of God another way, that is, for the libertie of the Goſpel, the appeaſing of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18363:144"/> fraternall diſcord, the winning of the more: the compaſſing of which in the performance of theſe Ceremonies were the true ſeruices of God. Wherefore euen the Ceremonies of the Apoſtles practiſe, were appropriate to the ſeruice of God: But theſe were not humane inuentions, but I haue ſhewed that they left in themſelues, to be Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and ſhould not haue beene practiſed without neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, that is, of doing ſeruice to God in theſe fore-named endes. And touching ſignification, ſome man might thus argue, that either the Iewiſh Ceremonies practiſed by the Apoſtles, had a ſignification in their intention, or none at all. If none, then they might ſeeme needleſſe and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and ſo the Apoſtles might ſeeme to be the practiſers of idle actions, which (ſay I) is moſt true, were it not by their practiſe to wine the more, and to furder the Goſpel, which made them actions very fruitfull, and to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But if they had ſignification in their intentions, then this ſignification was either true or falſe, not any falſe, as of Chriſt to come, which was their old and decaied ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Col. 2. vnleſſe they might haue ſtill a kinde of lawfull, and yet vntrue ſignification of Chriſt to come in their mindes, which expecting the Meſſias with an vpright heart, belieued not as yet in the Meſſias come; therefore they muſt haue ſome true ſignification, if any at all impoſed on them; but this we read not, therefore we cannot affirme (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that they had any ſignification at all: Wherefore I maruell my brethren would giue inſtance of the vſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacraments (ſuch a trifle to play withall) as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the Apoſtles, it might imply an abſurditie in vs, an euident impietie. But it will bee demanded, I know, that if I grant the Ceremonies of the Apoſtles practiſe, to bee void of ſignification in their intention, what then is this vnto our Ceremonies, which are ordained to teach ſpirituall duties, by their miſticall ſignification? But my brethren ſhould remember, that the queſtion here is not of the lawfulneſſe of impoſing ſignification on Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:18363:145"/> (not of Gods ordaining) but of the lawfulneſſe of the vſe of Ceremonies, in a caſe of neceſſitie, on which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſignification is impoſed by others: And thus theſe Ceremonies will accord to the point in queſtion. For ſeeing thoſe Ceremonies had a ſignification of the ſuperſtitious, and not well informed Iewes, before whom they were vſed by the Apoſtles, and for whoſe ſakes ſome of them, were inioyned to the Gentiles; the queſtion is whether an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in a caſe of ſuperior reaſon, as to redeeme Miniſterie, might conforme vnto them (or to the like in the like caſe) lawfully, notwithſtanding that ineuitable ſcandall, that hee ſhould occaſion vnto the beholders; namely, to apprehend by them I ſay, not a true ſignification (in which reſpect our ſignificatiue Ceremonie of the Croſſe ſeemeth more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) but a falſe, namely, to ſignifie to them Chriſt to come, which was already come. And if he might lawfully doe this (as it is euident he might) then let my brethren tell me, wherefore a Miniſter of the Goſpel, now may not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vſe ſuch a Ceremonie, which (being no commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God) is by others ordained and impoſed to teach ſpirituall things, by their myſticall ſignification, and not intentionally, or approuedly in the minde of the vſer.</p>
            <p>As for that which is included in the third difference, I muſt needes confeſſe it hath more waight, then any thing I know alleadged againſt our Ceremonies, if my brethren can ſoundly proue, that namely our Ceremonies are eſteemed impoſed, and obſerued as parts of Gods worſhips (whereby firſt of all I doubt not, but my brethren doe meane eſſentiall parts of Gods of worſhips, not accidentall) And ſecondly, that theſe our Ceremonies are eſteemed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and obſerued, by the intention and doctrine of the Church of England, for things of ſuch nature. For this I conſtantly auerre and reſolutely holde, that if they can be proued matter of this nature, that they are doubtleſſe to bee refuſed of all, in a caſe of confeſſion, vnto the loſſe of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18363:145"/> Miniſtery, and of life it ſelfe: Howbeit of this I can by no meanes be perſwaded as yet, and I will giue my Brethren the reaſons thereof, namely, becauſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth not ſo eſteeme them, impoſe them, or obſerue them for parts of Gods worſhip.</p>
            <p>But here it wil be firſt asked, what I mean by the Church of <hi>England?</hi> To which I anſwere, that as the Church is conſidered two wayes, firſt, for the Congregation of the faithfull, ſcattered here and there, or for the whole ſocietie of Engliſh men compact in one entire body, viſibly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the religion of Chriſt diſtinguiſhed from the bodies of <hi>Scotland, France, Germany,</hi> &amp; other Countreys: So by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in either acception, ceremonies are not eſteemed, impoſed, or vſed as parts of Gods worſhips. Of the Church in the former ſence, I know my Brethren make no queſtion; the latter I will iuſtifie: For the doctrine and practiſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I take to be that which by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon conſent of the whole State, King, Nobles, Biſhops, Iudges, Commons in Parliament is taught and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: Whatſoeuer commeth hence, cometh from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate bodie of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and is to bee aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to it, as to the viſible Church: Now the doctrine of this Church of <hi>England</hi> is included in the Bookes eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by this power, which are, the booke of Articles, and the booke of Common prayer: Now for the doctrine of our Church in this point, the booke of Articles expreſly teacheth: firſt, that it is not lawfull for the Church to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine any thing that is contrary to Gods word, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Church ought not to enforce any thing to be beleeued, beſides the holy Scriptures, for neceſſitie of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. Thirdly, that nothing of traditions and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies be ordained againſt Gods word, <hi>Act.</hi> 34. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that euery particular or Nationall Church hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to ordaine, change and aboliſh Ceremonies, or Rites of the Church, ordained onely by mans authoritie, ſo that all things bee done to edifying, <hi>Act.</hi> 34. So likewiſe the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18363:146"/> of the common prayer booke, tit. of Ceremonies ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by Act of Parliament (that is, by the authoritie of the viſible Church of <hi>England)</hi> this doctrine of Ceremonies is ſet downe: [We thinke it conuenient that euery country ſhould vſe ſuch Ceremonies as they ſhall thinke fit, to the ſetting forth of Gods honour and glory, and to the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of the people to a moſt peafect and godly liuing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out error or ſuperſtition: and that they ſhould put away o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which they perceiue to bee moſt abuſed, as in mens ordinances, it often chanceth diuerſly in diuers countreys. And thus wee ſee the doctrine of our Church doth not eſteeme any Ceremonies, as parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips but doth diſclaime it vtterly. And for the application of their doctrine to our Ceremonies that wee may ſee what maner of Ceremonies, and of what nature the Church of <hi>England</hi> doth propoſe to be practiſed, and with what affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch as practiſe them ſhould performe it: the ſaid Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Booke of Common prayer ſaith of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies preſcribed in that Booke: [That they are retained for a diſcipline and order, which vpon iuſt cauſes may bee altered and changed, and therfore not to be eſteemed equall to Gods Law.] Now according to this doctrine and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thereof by our Church all doctrines and practiſe of intention and action ſhould bee conformed, to this they ſhould be referred: If there bee any contrary direction or doctrine taught publiſhed, or inioyned by any one perſon, or many together, or in diuers places, it is nothing to the point: For they who preach eſteeme, practi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e and impoſe any Ceremonies otherwiſe, by any conceit, word or acte, then according to the afore mentioned direction they doe it contrary to the iudgement of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and it is to bee eſteemed as the iudgement and practiſe of priuate perſons, violating the doctrine and lawes of this Church, for the which they ſhall anſwere vnto God, and are liable to the cenſure of authoritie. Whatſoeuer Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie therefore of our Church is either impoſed, or the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18363:146"/> cenſured by any perſons, or by any Miniſter practiſed, or obſerued by ſuperſtitious or ignorant people, as a part of Gods worſhip, is onely accidentall, adherent, and not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to our Church; neither ought it to bee laide vnto the charge of our Church: Neither doe any of the Diuines, <note place="margin">Abridg. fol. 38. 39.</note> mentioned in the depriued Miniſters reaſons, nor can any Diuinity iuſtifie or ſay that the queſtioned Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies are impoſed by the Church as parts of Gods worſhips, for this cauſe, or will perſwade men to ſuffer themſelues to be depriued for refuſing to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme vnto them. For here is no ſuch caſe of confeſſion, to which we are inforced; ſeeing we may all freely and ought, as in obedience to the Church, confeſſe the doctrine thereof agreeing to Gods Word, and conforme vnto the Ceremonies according to the doctrine, namely, as to things which are no worſhips of God, nor needfull to ſaluation. And as for them that hold, teach, or conforme vnto them, as to the parts of Gods worſhips, they are to be eſteemed as malefactors condemned by the Church, which can no more preiudice the doctrine of the Church, then the practiſe of theeues, rebels, and murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers can preiudice the good lawes of our Common-wealth that are made againſt them; and it were no leſſe ſtrange to blemiſh our Church with the iudgement or practiſe of the one, then to brand the Common-wealth with the practiſe of the other.</p>
            <p>Now where my Brethren ſay that the Apoſtles neither obſerued nor impoſed the Ceremonies of the Iewes as parts of Gods worſhip, I referre them to my anſwere in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer member touching the ſeruice of God; and do adde that if they vſed them not as parts of Gods worſhip taken <hi>ſtrictè,</hi> yet they did vſe them &amp; inioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as parts of his worſhip taken <hi>latè,</hi> or in a larger ſence, ſeeing God may be ſaid to be worſhipped by that he is ſerued, and he is ſerued by duties done according to his will, and they conformed, &amp; inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to thoſe ceremonies that they might do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties according to his will, <hi>viz.</hi> the winning of the Iewes, the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18363:147"/> freedome of their teaching and the like. But now whereas it is demanded further by my Brethren, what it is vnto the purpoſe I alledge, that the Iewes eſteemed, impoſed, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them as neceſſary to ſaluation, Acts 15. 1. 5. and the reſt. I anſwere, firſt, that I might make thoſe Ceremonies analogicall with ours, that as our Ceremonies were and are holden as parts of Gods worſhip and needfull to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the Papiſts, ſo were thoſe practiſed by the Apoſtles, eſteemed by the Iewes; yet the Apoſtles vſed them in caſe of neceſſity, and ſo may wee theſe in the like caſe.

                  <hi>Abridg. fol.</hi> 38.</note> I euer held it as an argument vrged by the depriued Miniſters to perſwade to the diſuſe of our Ceremonies, that being in themſelues needleſſe (a man hauing no neceſſity to vſe them) there is occaſioned the ſtumbling of the weak, by them the Papiſts and ignorant peoples abuſe and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods worſhip: In which reſpect the practiſe of the Iewiſh Ceremonies might apparantly be taxed, had it not beene in a caſe of ſuperiour reaſon. For the practiſe of them was in that caſe good &amp; neceſſary, notwithſtanding what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer abuſe or offence might haue bin taken thereat, ſo that they were done, firſt, voluntarily and not preſſed on there conſcience as Gods worſhips; ſecondly on iuſt occaſion, as to redeeme the preaching of the Goſpell, and to win ſoules to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The fourth and laſt kinde of difference alleadged by my Brethren betweene our Ceremonies, and the ceremonies of Apoſtolicall practiſe and iniunction of the rules preſcribed in the word, for the direction of the Church in the matters of ceremony, which are not kept in the impoſing and vſing of our Ceremonies, (as my Brethren ſay) but were in thoſe others by the Apoſtles. Firſt, they ſay they are no way needefull: which may be vnderſtood either in reſpect of inioyning by our Gouernours, or of practiſing by our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. In the inioyning of them, againe we may conſider the inioyning of them in their firſt plantation, or for the preſent. The inioyning of them in the firſt plantation in
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18363:147"/> King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, of what neceſsity it was, it might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be collected, if we either conſider the nature of coacted Churches, gathered and reformed by authority of Princes, where the moſt are worſt, and of how great difficulty it is to reforme all diſorders at the firſt, in compariſon of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches gathered by voluntary coition, where all being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly aſſembled, will alſo willingly vnite their thoughts and proceedings to the beſt: and this is one maine reaſon of the different degrees of reformation of different Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. This Church of England therefore being a coacted Church, it is eaſie to imagine of what difficulty it was to reforme all things at the firſt; where the moſt part of the Priuy Counſel, of the Nobility, Biſhops, Iudges, Gentry, &amp; people were open or cloſe Papiſts: where few or none of any countenance ſtood for religion at the firſt, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, and <hi>Cranmer.</hi> Wherefore, howſoeuer thoſe worthy perſons were ſollicited and ſtirred vp by <hi>Caluins</hi> letters, howſoeuer they laboured at the firſt, and did what in them lay, deſiring to doe more, as appeareth in the Preface of the common prayer Booke, &amp; in the Rule before Comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: howſoeuer they refined the booke of Common prayer in <hi>an</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. <hi>Edwardi;</hi> yet neceſsity compelled them there to ſtay. The generall reaſons whereof, are excellently obſerued and ſet downe by <hi>Zepperus,</hi> which elſewhere I haue cited in my reaſons. Now if we looke to the preſent iniunction of our Ceremonies, it is not for me to conteſt with authority, or to call her to account for her proceedings; ſhe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth neceſſity of enioyning them; that <hi>omnis mutatio est pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculoſa, &amp; plena ſcandalis</hi> (and therefore alſo muſt be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for the only will and pleaſure of ſuch as inioyne them.) Now if authority on theſe, or other like grounds will haue the Ceremonies practiſed, or elſe will proceede to Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, there is heere an ineuitable neceſſity of conforming in the Miniſters: in which reſpect Conformity is ſimply needefull. In this ſenſe alſo, though the ceremonies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues be ſuppoſed to be ſmally profitable, yet conformity to
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:18363:148"/> them in this caſe of neceſsity, is moſt profitable for the edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of the Church, though it bee denied by my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. And howſoeuer it may be granted, that offence and hinderance to edification doe ariſe from theſe our Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; yet it is certaine that there is no ſhew of compariſon betweene the offence and hinderance of the peoples edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ariſing from the practiſe of the Ceremonies, and the ſuffring of Depriuation for not conforming by euery Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which my Brethren in their argument doe teach. Now for the Iewiſh ceremonies, to omit my Brethrens repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Appſtolicall authority, as being dealt withall before; they ſay they were ſquared and directed by the rules of the holy ſcripture. But to vnderſtand this better, we muſt needs diſtinguiſh betweene the different reſpects wherein wee may conſider them, firſt in their nature, and then in their practiſe, and then againe as it was needleſſe or conſtrained, or occaſioned by iuſt reaſon of neceſsity for the furtherance of the word, and good of the Church. In their nature they were fruitleſſe, vnprofitable, empty, burdenſome, and moſt indecent. Alſo in their needleſſe vſe they were not needfull or profitable, they ſerued rather to deſtroy then edifie. They were not profitable for order or decency, they tended to infringe the Chriſtian liberty, and they were ſo farre from hauing no offence in them, that they were aboue meaſure ſcandolous; all which I haue ſo proued to my Brethren, in my firſt and ſecond reaſons of this my firſt argument, that though they deny and wonder, yet they meddle not with any proofe thereof, knowing that the very citation of the place would confute them. But in their conſtrained vſe, or vſe occaſioned by reaſons of neceſſity forealleadged, that conformity to theſe Ceremonies was profitable, neceſſary, ſeruing to edifie, by making way vnto the Churches peace, and preaching of the Goſpel, it was ordered to vſe them: and this vſe of the practiſe of indecent Ceremonies, in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did vphold one higher decency, euen the decency of Apoſtolicall preaching, conuerting ſoules, planting of
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18363:148"/> Churches, and vnitie of brethren, and thus that paradoxe or riddle is abſolued, which my brethren thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to bee belieued, that an indecency, ſupported de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, which if they had called to their remembrance, they might haue ſeene how this fourth argument, of the abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt our Ceremonies, doeth very fitly ſquare to thoſe which the Apoſtles vſed.</p>
            <p>Yet one thing remameth to bee conſidered, which ſo much offendeth my brethren, that they ſcarce hold it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, for a godly or learned man to hold, namely, to charge the holy Apoſtles; firſt, that they were offended in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that they did; and ſecondly, that they taught againſt the things which they iniòyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that namely, they ought not to bee vſed by the Iewes or Gentiles. But to the firſt I ſay, that if it were neceſſitie, that moued the Apoſtles to inioyne abſtinence from bloud and ſtrangled, which were legall Ceremonies, for they are called neceſſary things <hi>fol.</hi> 15. 28. yea without that neceſſitie, they would not haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned them: if without neceſſitie vrging, they would not haue inioyned them, yea they muſt needes bee vnwilling, and loth to doe that which without neceſſitie, they would not doe: If they were loth to doe it, then they muſt needes haue ſome offence in them, for doing that they were loth to doe: And for the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let me remember my brethren, who thinke I forget my ſelfe, once againe to ſay vnto them, that the holy Apoſtles did teach againſt the things, which they inioyned and practiſed, as appeareth by theſe plaine inſtances <hi>Paul</hi> preached againſt circumciſion, Acts 21. 21. Gal. 5. 2. and ſo did <hi>Peter</hi> before the practiſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yet <hi>Paul</hi> practiſed circumciſion on <hi>Timothy,</hi> Acts 16. 3. <hi>Paul</hi> preached againſt the Iewiſh Sabboths obſeruation, Col. 2. 16. 17. Gal. 4. 10. yet he obſerued them vſually, Acts 13. 14. 44. and 18. 4. and 17. 2. <hi>Paul</hi> taught againſt abſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from meates [touch not; taſt not; handle not] Col. 2. 20. 21. yet the Apoſtles (and <hi>Paul</hi> among them) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed difference of meates, Acts 15. 28. Let my brethren
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18363:149"/> therefore giue me leaue, to thinke without any further mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, that though I grant it were abſurd and impious, to ſuppoſe that the Apoſtles practiſed thoſe Ceremonies they preached againſt in the ſelfe ſame reſpect, and ſo farre forth as they practiſed them, ſo farre forth to preach againſt them; yet in diuers reſpects this may well ſtand. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles therefore preached againſt the Ceremonies, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they held them ſimply impious in themſelues, for then they could not practiſe them without impietie, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Chriſt the bodie was come, the ſhadowes were vnprofitable, and becauſe that many abuſed them pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and held them neceſſary to ſaluation, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in ſome caſes the Apoſtles refuſed the practiſe of them: Againe, the Apoſtles practiſed them not, of any loue they bare them, or for any opinion of neceſſitie, or the leaſt profit in themſelues, being impotent and beggarly; but onely being compelled for the neceſſitie of the ſuperior ends, which themſelues doe giue of ſuch their doings. My brethren deny not but that the Apoſtles practiſed theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, <note place="margin">

But they cannot be perſwaded, that they preached againſt the practiſe of them, yet <hi>Caluin</hi> will teach them, that <hi>Stephen</hi> did long before preach the aboliſhing of the ceremoniall law: And for this very place of Acts 21. 21. whereof my brethren are ſo peremptorie, that <hi>Paul</hi> had not taught ſo in deed, but that the Iewes had beene ſo informed of him, that hee preached againſt the practiſe of the Iewiſh Ceremonies: Howbeit, <hi>Caluin</hi> appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends it otherwiſe <hi>[Etiamſi aliquâ ex parte verus erat rumor, quo offenſi fuerunt Iudaei, fuiſſe tamen callumniâ asperſam Legis abrogationem docebat Paulus.]</hi> Againe. <hi>[Qui aduentu Christi abolit as fuiſſe Ceremonias docent, adeò non ſunt in legem contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melioſi, vt potius eius veritatem confirmant]</hi> Againe. <hi>[Non minus Iudaeos, quàm gentes a Ceremonijs liberat, quas col.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>decretanominat]</hi> Aagaine <hi>[Paulus promiſcuè Iudaeis &amp; Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus libertatem docebat partam eſſe: Nam istae ſententiae generales ſunt,</hi> 1.

Now of the third member, touching the warrant &amp; ground of conformity. In the anſwere whereunto my Brethren be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the practiſe of a fallacy, which is called, <hi>fallacia compoſitionis,</hi> my Brethren might vnderſtand (for they lacke not ſenſe) that as the former part of their aſſumption (which they would haue me ſpeake [That namely, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by diuine inſpiration, and commaundement from God, required the Churches to vſe] was not intended to be connected or ioyned with the latter part, which is, [To vſe ſuch and ſo many Ceremonies] ſo was it not immediatly ioyned with it in my propoſition; nay, in the proofe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it was diſioyned and placed by it ſelfe, and the proper or peculiar Scripture of probation annexed to it. Inaſmuch as (without violence offered) they muſt needs vnderſtand the inioyning of the Apoſtles to bee vndrſtood of <hi>Act.</hi> 15. onely, and the number to haue reference to <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. where the Ceremonies were enumerated: now my Brethren or
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:18363:150"/> their anſwerer, (whome it ſeemed they truſted in ſundrie things too farre) takes my proofes for number, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to inioyning; and the decree of inioyning, where there was but two Ceremonies, they applied to number: The which confuſed ſhuffling of things together, which ſhould be ſeparatly conſidered (as they were propoſed and proued) is done but to make ſhew of abſurditie in my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which is but the tricke and cunning of a Sophiſter, to get aduantage to his feeble cauſe, and not the direct dealing of a ſound diſputant, which my Brethren needed not to borrow for the defence of that they are aſſured is the trueth.</p>
            <p>This beeing obſerued, my anſwere is the ſooner made. To the Contents of their firſt member of Replie, touching the number, I referre them backe to the place in my anſwer, which they referre mee to theirs. To the ſecond mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my Brethren ſtill remaine vnmindfull, that the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not of inioyning here, but of conforming in a caſe of neceſſitie: But the force of my reaſon drawen from the Apoſtles inioyning thoſe Ceremonies <hi>(Act.</hi> 15.) ſtands in this, that if the Apoſtles in caſe of neceſſity did inioyne Ceremonies to Churches, as inconuenient as ours are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to bee in many maine reſpects (as they did act 15.) then might they much more practiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or the like in the caſe of neceſſity. As for the circumciſion of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> perſwaſion to <hi>Paul,</hi> they are brought in to proue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other member of my propoſition and not this.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:18363:150"/> is it to the point, when I ſpeake of inioyning, and doe bring a place to proue it, for them to inſiſt vpon the number; but according to the old ſaying, <hi>Ego de allijs, tu de caepis,</hi> which might bee referred to the Dialogue of <hi>Eraſmuus de abſurdis?</hi> As for the enſuing repetion of the things which before they alleadged in the ſame words almoſt, [that the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned in Act. 15. were not Ceremonies: that they were impoſed not as ceremoniall, but as morall dueties: that <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi> his circumciſion was not a Sacrament, and the reſt: they are by me ſufficiently replyed vnto before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> The fourth and laſt member of my aſſumption, is of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuffering depriuation, where my Brethren in their anſwere beginne againe with miſreporting of my wordes: For my reaſon ſaith not, that the Apoſtles and Churches were moued to inioyne and practiſe Ceremonies for rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of no greater weight; but for reaſons partly equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and partly inferiour to the auoiding of depriuation. And I am ſorry that in ſo little compaſſe of two or three ſheets of paper my Brethren ſhould ſo many times ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlip themſelues, which if in this part of their anſwere they had not done, it had beene to ſmall purpoſe to bring in ſo large a proofe of that (in the firſt Section heereof) which no man denieth that the Apoſtles office is of greater dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie or excellency, then the office of an inferiour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For in that I ſaid partly equiuolent, I left roome enough for any man to vnderſtand that the reaſons were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether equiuolent; and yet this very point being <hi>caeteris pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus,</hi> vnderſtood as the office of a Miniſter, is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, as well as the office of an Apoſtle; ſo the one in theſe dayes is no leſſe neceſſary for the ſaluation of the faithfull man now, then the other then: and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in theſe dayes ought no leſſe to bee carefull of the loſſe of his Miniſtery; or interruption of the Goſpell, then the Apoſtles then: and therefore I ſee not but the ſame reaſons and practiſe they vſed then to that end, we ſhould alſo now vſe for the profit of Gods Church.</p>
            <pb n="276" facs="tcp:18363:151"/>
            <p> Next, in the ſecond place there is one thing by the way, that I cannot be perſwaded of that my Brethren ſay, that the very vſing of the Iewiſh ceremonies then would edifie; whereas they ſhould rather ſay, that the effect of ſuch vſe did edifie onely: For that the bare vſe of them being in it ſelfe conſidered, might in many reſpects be ſcandalous, and did miniſter occaſion to the corrupt Iewes of ſtumbling, as I haue prooued. But it is much, that my Brethren ſhould affirme, that conformity to our Ceremonies to preuent Depriuation, ſhould not doe any good at all; and further, that a Miniſter ſhould doe much more hurt by his confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, then good by his Miniſtry: As if the liberty of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the word were ſo great good by the Apoſtles practiſe to the Church, and with vs (by Gods bleſſing on his owne ordinance) it were no good at all: Or as if the practiſe of the ceremonies would nullifie or confound the bleſſing of Gods ordinance of preaching (and then how can the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of Conformitans bee bleſſed of God?) Or as if the vſe of our Ceremonies would deſtroy more ſoules, then preaching could conuert or eſtabliſh in the faith: Or (laſt of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as if the vſe of the ceremonies were more apt and forcible to peruert a man to his deſtruction, then preaching to conuert him to ſaluation. Which ſuppoſals as they are moſt vntrue, and my Brethren I know will not denie: ſo if they graunt them to be falſe, a Miniſter conforming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the free paſſage of his preaching, ſhall haue a better bargaine out of queſtion by his practiſe, then my Brethren heere doe vndertake to driue on his behalfe.</p>
            <p>Now touching the laſt point, if my Brethren will haue me grant, that the Apoſtles were well aſſured in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences they did that which was not onely lawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but needfull for them to doe: Then ſtill I muſt needs conclude, that ſo long as we doe performe the like practiſe with them in the like caſe, and on the like reaſons, (as it doeth yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) wee may very well haue aſſurance ſufficient for it in our hearts; And ſo in degree (according to our modell) we
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:18363:151"/> may be ſaid to haue an equiualent reaſon for the auoyding of our Depriuation. As for that full aſſurance, which my brethren ſay they enioy; namely, that they haue Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement to the contrary, and that they ſhould doe euill in the ſight of the Lord, to conforme vnto our Ceremonies, euen to auoid de priuation: It ſeemeth to me a ſpeach, neither Theologicall nor ſafe. I ſay not The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologicall, for that Theologie is aſſurance of matters fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall, which in their nature are onely euident, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable among the faithfull, which this is not. And I ſay againe not ſafe; becauſe, as wee are expreſſely charged not to call good euill: ſo if our Ceremonies ſhould in their nature proue indifferent, wee ſhould feare to call them ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and in nature euill, both becauſe it is vntrue, and the conſequences are pernicious, which come from thence. And if it bee good and needfull in a caſe of depriuation, to conforme vnto our Ceremonies, as all good iudgements, and godly learned teachers and Churches haue taught, till now our brethren are become aſſured otherwiſe: Me thinks this plerophoricall confidence of my brethren ſhould not bee ſo ſafe for them; but rather to ſet a ſide all ancient preiudice, to hearken carefully to that which is diſputed, and concluded by the chiefeſt lights, and iudgements that euer the Church of Chriſt ſince the time of the Apoſtles obtained of God; to iudge charitably of their differing bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and modeſtly of themſelues; and to iudge nothing before the time, till the Lord come, who will lighten things that are hid in darkeneſſe: And if they will not yeeld vnto this trueth, yet to leaue it as a matter of diſputall nature till the day doe try, and the fire conſume the ſtubble of the errors of Gods faithfull ſeruants.</p>
